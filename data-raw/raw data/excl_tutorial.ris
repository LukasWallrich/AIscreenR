AB  - Objective evidence which supports an association between the forward flexion test (FFT) and sacroiliac joint dysfunction is lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of a positive FFT in a sample of young adults (N = 128), and to examine the association of factors such as low back pain, pelvic skeletal asymmetry, age, height, weight, and stance asymmetry. The history of back pain and the results of the FFT were recorded and measurements of height, weight, preferred stance angle and asymmetry ratio were taken. Descriptive statistics were used to present the anthropometric and FFT data, and t-tests were used to examine differences between females and males, and subjects with and without a positive FFT. The 0.05 level of significance was selected. Of the subjects tested 24% (n = 31 ) had a positive FFT and the highest occurrence of a positive FFT was in male subjects (n = 19). Nine asymptomatic subjects had a positive FFT. Statistically significant differences were observed between the positive and negative FFT groups for height, weight and asymmetry ratio (p > 0.05). It is concluded that factors other than sacroiliac joint dysfunction are likely to be the cause of a positive FFT Objective evidence which supports an association between the forward flexion test (FFT) and sacroiliac joint dysfunction is lacking.

AB  - Inter-patient comparisons of cardiovascular metrics indicative of patient health have been shown to be successful in differentiating patients on a group rather than an individual level. This is in part due to the range of mental (as well as physical) activity-based variations for each patient and the difficulty assessing physical and mental activity during conscious states. In order to provide an objective scale for measuring central nervous system activity during sleep, the heart rate (RR) interval time series is divided into coarse sleep stage segments in which the LF/HF-ratio (the relative balance between low and high frequency power) is estimated for age and sex-matched populations of apnoeic and healthy subjects. Activity-based noise is therefore reduced and a more useful comparison of heart rate variability can be made. Additionally, the spectral estimation performances of the FFT and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), a Fourier-based technique for unevenly sampled time series are compared. Separation of patients according to condition is shown to be more pronounced when using the LSP than the FFT. Furthermore, separation is found to be most marked in slow wave sleep Inter-patient comparisons of cardiovascular metrics indicative of patient health have been shown to be successful in differentiating patients on a group rather than an individual level.

AB  - This pilot study compared the efficacy of two models of family therapy plus medication in the treatment of ten schizophrenic patients previously considered poor responders to neuroleptics alone. Focal Family Therapy (FFT), a limited psychodynamic model, was compared with Supportive Management Counselling (SMC), an educative, problem-solving approach. Family treatment was begun during admission to hospital and continued for up to six months post-discharge. Patient and family measures were administered on assessment, termination, and at three, six and 12 month follow-up interviews. Our data suggest that patients in both groups improved significantly following treatment on measures of social functioning and community tenure. The average increase in amount of time out of hospital was a full year, compared to previous rates. Patients receiving FFT demonstrated significantly greater improvement in symptoms, compared to patients in the SMC group. On average, families scored in the normal range on the family functioning measure at assessment and upon termination of treatment This pilot study compared the efficacy of two models of family therapy plus medication in the treatment of ten schizophrenic patients previously considered poor responders to neuroleptics alone.

AB  - The topic of this study was to evaluate state-dependent effects of diazepam on the frequency characteristics of 47-channel spontaneous EEG maps. A novel method, the FFT-Dipole-Approximation was used to study effects on the strength and the topography of the maps in the different frequency bands. Map topography was characterized by the 3-dimensional location of the equivalent dipole source and map strength was defined as the spatial standard deviation (the Global Field Power) of the maps of each frequency point. The Global Field Power can be considered as a measure of the amount of energy produced by the system, while the source location gives an estimate of the center of gravity of all sources in the brain that were active at a certain frequency. State-dependency was studied by evaluating the drug effects before and after a continuous performance task of 25 min duration. Clear interactions between drug (diazepam vs. placebo) and time after drug intake (before and after the task) were found, especially in the inferior-superior location of the dipole sources. It supports the hypothesis that diazepam, like other drugs, has different effects on brain functions depending on the momentary functional state of the brain. In addition to the drug effects, clearly different source locations and Global Field Power were found for the different frequency bands, replicating earlier reports.

AB  - Since EEG is one of the most important sources of information in therapy of epilepsy, several researchers tried to address the issue of decision support for such a data. In this paper, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers); the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Logistic regression as well as feedforward error backpropagation artificial neural networks (FEBANN) and wavelet neural networks (WNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used FFT and autoregressive (AR) model by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or nonepileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying AR with MLE in connection with WNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The network is constructed by the error backpropagation neural network using Morlet mother wavelet basic function as node activation function. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The WNN-based classifier outperformed the FEBANN and logistic regression based counterpart.

AB  - This paper presents new projections based on a reappraisal of the current (1971) age distribution and the vital rates. After reviewing previous population projections for India, the demographic implications of 18 combinations of future fertility and mortality are examined. The most likely among these, in the authors' assessment, would yield a population of 922- 970 million in 2001. Using a range of mortality assumptions the authors are able to demonstrate that Indian mortality is still high enough for its future course to have significant impact on population growth. A Postscript presents three extended hypothetical projections based on reaching a net reproduction rate of unity and on simulating the mortality and fertility consequences of major disasters and major social change. All three indicate the high potential for future population growth even in the face of quite radical changes in vital rates.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To improve the diagnostic power of high resolution electrocardiography for discriminating patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias, new methods based on spectral analysis have been used in recent years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods for predicting the risk of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in patients after myocardial infarction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: High resolution ECG were recorded in 129 post-infarction patients and 23 healthy volunteers. Of the post-infarction patients: 62 presented with ventricular tachycardia, 23 with ventricular fibrillation, while 44 had no clinically relevant arrhythmias. The ECG signals were recorded in three orthogonal X, Y, Z leads and averaged using cross-correlation method. Spectral analysis was performed by fast Fourier transform and the parametric modeling method with autoregressive model. Spectral analysis data were evaluated quantitatively by computing normality factor for FFT and spectral factor for AR. RESULTS: Both methods were found to be useful for evaluating the risk of arrhythmias. The sensitivity of ventricular tachycardia risk evaluation was higher (81%--FFT, 73%--AR) than that of evaluating the risk of ventricular fibrillation (30%--FFT, 48%--AR). The specificity in post-infarction patients without arrhythmias (93%--FFT, 84%--AR) was as high as that in healthy subjects (96%--FFT, 87%--AR). CONCLUSIONS: Spectral analysis of HRECG is an effective method for evaluating the risk of VT and VF in patients after myocardial infarction INTRODUCTION: To improve the diagnostic power of high resolution electrocardiography for discriminating patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias, new methods based on spectral analysis have been used in recent years.

AB  - Tremor is frequently encountered in neurologic practice. Clinical examination supplies information regarding its approximative frequency, regularity, amplitude, topography and activation conditions. The neurophysiological study helps in confirming the tremor, in differentiating it from other movement disorders like myoclonus, and may provide distinctive features which are important for the aetiological diagnosis. The neurophysiological investigation includes accelerometry, which analyses the mechanics of the movement. Spectral analysis with FFT allows the determination of frequency and amplitude. Accelerometry is always associated with surface EMG of at least two antagonistic muscles. It may show rhythmic bursts, their frequency, duration and activation pattern (alternating or synchronous). This neurophysiological approach to tremor has multiple interests. It may help in differentiating a true rest tremor from a postural tremor seemingly persisting at rest. Brief interruptions or rhythm breaks during distraction manoeuvers are seen in psychogenic tremors. Surface EMG may also demonstrate positive myoclonic bursts, or brief silent periods corresponding to negative myoclonus, sometimes pseudorhythmic, thus appearing clinically like a tremor, but investigations, aetiologies and treatment are different. Several features, especially slow frequency, may suggest a midbrain tremor, thus requiring brain imagery centered around the posterior fossa. Finally, the neurophysiological examination is the only way to demonstrate a primary writing tremor, or a primary orthostatic tremor, the frequency of which is pathognomonic while clinical symptoms are rather misleading. [References: 79] Tremor is frequently encountered in neurologic practice. Clinical examination supplies information regarding its approximative frequency, regularity, amplitude, topography and activation conditions. The neurophysiological study helps in confirming the tremor, in differentiating it from other movement disorders like myoclonus, and may provide distinctive features which are important for the aetiological diagnosis. The neurophysiological investigation includes accelerometry, which analyses the mechanics of the movement. Spectral analysis with FFT allows the determination of frequency and amplitude. Accelerometry is always associated with surface EMG of at least two antagonistic muscles. It may show rhythmic bursts, their frequency, duration and activation pattern (alternating or synchronous). This neurophysiological approach to tremor has multiple interests. It may help in differentiating a true rest tremor from a postural tremor seemingly persisting at rest. Brief interruptions or rhythm breaks during distraction manoeuvers are seen in psychogenic tremors.

AB  - Obturator prostheses have been extensively used in the functional rehabilitation of maxillectomy patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro the vibration movements of three types of obturator prostheses. Three types of bulbs were used: the solid type, the buccal flange type, and the hollow type. Modal analysis was performed to identify the better form. The three types of obturator prostheses were excited by a shaker, and the frequency response functions were recorded on an FFT analyzer to identify their modal shapes. In addition, transient response simulations were carried out, and decay rates of the resultant transient response waves were compared to evaluate the energy absorption after the obturator prosthesis had experienced an impact. The results showed that the modal shapes were closely similar, while the amplitudes at the rests and clasps of the hollow type bulb were the smallest. In the transient response simulation, the decay rates of the hollow type were significantly the highest (p < 0.01). In this study, modal analysis demonstrated that the hollow type obturator prosthesis showed the steepest vibration decay slope, indicating that it might be the best among the three types of bulbs for use in clinical treatments Obturator prostheses have been extensively used in the functional rehabilitation of maxillectomy patients.

AB  - Spontaneous and provoked changes of vigilance and consciousness are determined by TCS (thalamocortical system) activity. This is relatively easy to monitor using EEG, which is a complex curve but open to analysis, e.g., by means of FFT (fast Fourier transformation). Twenty six persons (six normal controls, twelve epileptics, eight dements) had EEG recorded during rest, reaction to sound, and perception to simple tones or chords from Smetana's symphonic poem Vysehrad. The length of reaction time was found dependent on FFT changes: the longer the time, the higher are the delta and the lower the alpha activities in the EEG spectrum. However, with alpha increasing during relaxation, the reaction time grew longer regardless of whether delta had increased due to hyperventilation, sleep or subclinical epileptic discharges. During the perception of tones, FFT showed changes in the alpha and delta bands different from those during the perception of chords, and different again during relaxation, and that in both normal controls and epileptics. The demented persons revealed no discernible FFT differences in the perception of either tones or chords, the only differences were found in the resting sections of the spectrum. One and the same stimulus produced a stereotype FFT response, i.e., different stimuli elicited different FFT response in healthy and epileptic persons. The dements responded to identical stimuli differently, and had stereotype FFT response elicited by the same stimuli. The results suggest that FFT can represent the information content of the EEG curve and, indirectly, also that of micro-EEG as it reverberates between the thalamus and the cortex in the form of neuronal activity impulsations. This interneuronal impulsation coding is disordered in dements with atrophy of the cortex; it is marked, on the one hand, by increased variability in the perception of identical stimuli, and, on the other hand, by impaired differentiation, and, consequently, by increasingly stereotype responses to different stimuli Spontaneous and provoked changes of vigilance and consciousness are determined by TCS (thalamocortical system) activity.

AB  - HITS (high intensity transient signals) in transcranial Doppler recordings reflect either microemboli, both gaseous and solid, or artefacts. Various frequencies in number of microembolic signals (MES) have been reported in the same clinical condition. A possible explanation for these discrepancies may be different device settings and algorithms for embolus detection. For reproducibility of data, we suggest that studies on MES report the following parameters: (1) Ultrasound device; (2) transducer type; (3) insonated artery; (4) insonation depth; (5) algorithms for signal intensity measurement; (6) scale settings; (7) detection threshold; (8) axial extension of sample volume; (9) fast Fourier transform (FFT) size (number of points used); (10) FFT length (time); (11) FFT overlap; (12) transmitted ultrasound frequency; (13) high pass filter settings; and (14) recording time. No current system of automatic embolus detection has the full sensitivity and specificity required for clinical use. Therefore, each of the signals detected by these devices needs to be checked and verified by an experienced investigator. MES will help to identify the site and activity of the embolizing lesion. Microembolus detection might reduce the observation time and the number of patients needed to perform interventional trials. First, however, MES needs to be validated as a meaningful prognostic parameter. Microemboli originating from prosthetic cardiac valves are mainly gaseous. Therefore, they cannot serve as an indicator of the valves thromboembolic activity or the patient's stroke risk. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Flunitrazepam (FNZ) (4mg), an intermediate type benzodiazepine (BDZ) hypnotic, was administered orally to five healthy male subjects (Ss) for seven consecutive nights. Sleep EEG from the baseline night (BLN), the initial drug night (IDN), the fourth and the seventh drug nights (4DN, 7DN) was subjected to fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. During NREM sleep of 4DN and 7DN the sigma band (11.0-12.5 Hz) activity was similarly enhanced in every S. In REM of 4DN and 7DN beta band (23.0-29.0 Hz) was enhanced, but with larger variations among Ss. High intra-individual consistency of the relative EEG power patterns on 4DN and 7DN was observed. These results suggest that 1) EEG responses to FNZ are different in sleep states; explorations of these differences may provide better understandings of sleep mechanisms, and 2) individual variations in EEG responses may reflect individual variations of the BDZ receptor system.

AB  - We evaluated the potential for using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis applied to a standard ventilator waveform to estimate (< 2 Hz) frequency dependence of respiratory or lung resistance (R) and elastance (E). In four healthy humans we measured pressure and flow at the airway opening while applying sine wave forcing from 0.2 to 0.6 Hz at two tidal volumes (VT; 250 and 500 ml). We then applied a step inspiratory ventilator flow wave with relaxed expiration at the same VT and only 0.2 Hz. Step waveform data were also acquired from nine mechanically ventilated patients under intensive care unit conditions. Finally, we simultaneously measured total respiratory (rs), lung (L), and chest wall (cw) impedance data from two dogs (0.156-2 Hz) before and after severe pulmonary edema. Rrs and Ers were estimated by the FFT approach. Humans displayed a small frequency dependence in Rrs and Ers from 0.2 to 0.6 Hz, and both Rrs and Ers decreased at the higher VT. The spectral estimates of Rrs and Ers with the step ventilator wave were often qualitatively comparable to sine wave results below 0.6 Hz but became extremely erratic above the third harmonic. Conversely, in dogs the step wave produced reliable and stable estimates up to 2 Hz in all conditions. Nevertheless, Ecw and Ers still displayed clear and correlated oscillations with increasing frequency, whereas EL showed none. This suggests that nonlinear processes, most likely at the chest wall, contribute to periodic-like fluctuations in respiratory mechanical properties when estimated by applying FFT to a step ventilator wave. Moreover, in humans, but not dogs, a ventilator flow cycle contains insufficient signal energy beyond the third harmonic. We show that the amount of energy available at higher frequencies is largely governed by the mechanical time constant contributing to passive expiratory flow. In dogs the shorter time constant contributes to increased energy. In essence, the frequency content of the flow is subject dependent, and this is not a desirable situation for controlling the quality of the impedance spectra available from a standard ventilator wave We evaluated the potential for using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis applied to a standard ventilator waveform to estimate (< 2 Hz) frequency dependence of respiratory or lung resistance (R) and elastance (E).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The signal-averaged ECG has been used to detect late potentials, and it is considered a noninvasive marker for areas of slow conduction requisite for reentrant arrhythmia. Late potentials are not usually found in patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT); nevertheless, fragmented electrograms are often recorded in those patients during endocardial mapping. The purpose of this study was to investigate the spectral content of the signal-averaged ECGs with use of fast Fourier transform analysis (FFT) in patients with idiopathic VT of left ventricular origin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Signal-averaged ECGs were recorded in 12 patients with idiopathic VT originating from the left ventricle (group 1) and 25 age-matched normal volunteers (group 2). Frequency analysis with FFT was performed with a Blackman-Harris window in a segment length of 120 msec from 40 msec before the end of the QRS complex, and the frequency spectrum was displayed in a three-dimensional graph. Area ratio 1 (area of 20-50 Hz/area of 10-50 Hz) and area ratio 2 (area of 40-100 Hz/area of 0-40 Hz) were calculated in all subjects. Late potentials defined by the time domain were negative in all subjects. The area ratios of group 1 were significantly higher than those of group 2. High-frequency components in the three-dimensional graph were confined within the QRS complex. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that frequency analysis of signal-averaged ECGs with FFT is an available method for detecting the high-frequency component within the QRS complex in some patients with idiopathic VT of left ventricular origin BACKGROUND: The signal-averaged ECG has been used to detect late potentials, and it is considered a noninvasive marker for areas of slow conduction requisite for reentrant arrhythmia.

AB  - Expired and inspired tracheal breathing sounds (BS) were recorded from 10 normal subjects and 8 patients with respiratory diseases, including bronchial asthma, sarcoidosis, fibrosing lung disease, chronic bronchitis, and radiation pneumonitis. Frequency spectra were generated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and we observed considerable differences between BS spectra of normal subjects and patients. The frequency of peak amplitude and mean frequency of the BS spectra of patients were significantly higher than those of normal subjects. Spectral features were extracted by dividing each spectra into equal frequency bands--each feature being the mean amplitude of each FFT element within a frequency band. We used Principal Component Analysis to compare spectral feature sets and found a clear separation between normal and abnormal tracheal BS for 10, 20, and 40 features/spectra. We conclude that Principal Component Analysis of BS could become a new method of diagnosing respiratory disease in an automated fashion Expired and inspired tracheal breathing sounds (BS) were recorded from 10 normal subjects and 8 patients with respiratory diseases, including bronchial asthma, sarcoidosis, fibrosing lung disease, chronic bronchitis, and radiation pneumonitis.

AB  - Cancer therapy using chemotherapeutic drugs frequently involves injection of the drug into the body through some intravenous mode of administration, viz, continuous (drip) infusion or single/multiple bolus injection(s). An understanding of the effect of the various modes of administration upon tumor penetration of drug is essential to rational design of drug therapy. This paper investigates drug penetration into a model tumor of slab geometry (between two capillaries) in which the overall transport rate of drug is limited by intra-tumor transport characterized by an effective diffusion coefficient. Employing the method of Finite Fourier Transforms (FFT), analytical solutions have been obtained for transient drug distribution in both the plasma and the tumor following three modes of administration, viz, continuous infusion, single bolus injection and equally-spaced equal-dose multiple bolus injections, of a given amount of drug. The qualitative trends exhibited by the plasma drug distribution profiles are consistent with reported experimental studies. Two concepts, viz, the dimensionless decay constant and the plasma/tumor drug concentration trajectories, are found to be particularly useful in the rational design of drug therapy. The dimensionless decay constant provides a measure of the rate of drug decay in the plasma relative to the rate of drug diffusion into the tumor and is thus characteristic of the tumor/drug system. The magnitude of this parameter dictates the choice of drug administration mode for minimizing drug decay in the plasma while simultaneously maximizing drug transport into the tumor. The concentration trajectories provide a measure of the plasma drug concentration relative to the tumor drug concentration at various times following injection. When the tumor drug concentration exceeds the plasma drug concentration, the drug will begin to diffuse out of the tumor. Knowledge of the time at which this diffusion reversal occurs is especially useful for optimum scheduling of subsequent bolus injections in a multiple bolus dosing regimen. There are no reported applications of the FFT method to solve repeated input functions in either the chemical engineering or pharmaceutical science literature. Thus, the application of FFT method to solve multiple bolus injections is a unique one. Use of this FFT based analysis as a predictor tool can limit the number of costly experiments which are being done now to achieve this purpose. Even though the model in its present form is simplified, the analysis thereof has nevertheless led to a better understanding of the various factors that must be taken into account for rational design of drug therapy Cancer therapy using chemotherapeutic drugs frequently involves injection of the drug into the body through some intravenous mode of administration, viz, continuous (drip) infusion or single/multiple bolus injection(s).

AB  - Loss of body fat and lean body mass are features of critical illness, and anabolism is difficult to achieve despite parenteral nutrition. Resting energy expenditure (REE), free fatty acid turnover (FFT) and glycerol turnover (glyTO) were measured in septic, mechanically ventilated cancer-bearing patients, both fasting and immediately following or during a glucose infusion providing 87% of REE. No patient was in septic shock nor required pressor support. In the fasting state, REE was greatly elevated compared with basal energy expenditure calculated using the Harris-Benedict equations. Fasting FFT (14.2 +/- 0.9 mumol/kg/min) and glyTO (4.7 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg/min) were elevated compared with normal humans. Fasting respiratory quotient (RQ) was 0.68 +/- 0.02 and did not rise significantly with glucose. Fat appears to be the preferred calorie source in septic, cancer-bearing humans even in the presence of glucose. As similar, but less pronounced, changes have been seen in septic and injured humans without cancer, it is likely that these changes are not cancer-specific Loss of body fat and lean body mass are features of critical illness, and anabolism is difficult to achieve despite parenteral nutrition.

AB  - The EEG analysis in the time domain provides several advantages compared to the power spectra analysis, based on a FFT. There is the possibility to differentiate frequency, amplitude and other elementary characteristics of the wave form. This technique of EEG analysis is based on the definition of distinct characteristics of the wave form. Problems for calculating the frequency distribution arise--according to Harner, 1977--due to the fact, that the digitalization rate has to be very fast to reach an adequate resolution. On the other hand a high digitalization rate of 5 ms or below produces problems concerning the limited memory capacity of laboratory computers, especially if more than one derivation should be analysed simultaneously, to make further topological analyses possible. Three procedures of EEG analysis to calculate frequency distributions are shown, two of them are based on an interpolation technique to calculate adjusted minima-maxima. The results of these procedures using two different digitalization rates, were compared and discussed to respect similarity of resulting frequency distributions The EEG analysis in the time domain provides several advantages compared to the power spectra analysis, based on a FFT.

AB  - Snoring occurs as a major symptom in patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The aetiology of snoring remains still unclear despite various attempts to localize snoring. The correlation between different snoring sounds and the severity of SDB has not yet been investigated in a larger population. The aim of this study was to record and analyse snoring sounds and to correlate the obtained data with clinical and polysomnographical parameters. Sixty male patients with suspected SDB and reported snoring underwent a clinical examination and night time polysomnography. The parallel digitally recorded snoring sounds were analysed by fast fourier transformation (FFT). Peak intensity was determined from the power spectrum. The periodicity of snoring was classified into rhythmic and non-rhythmic snoring according to the presence of air flow interruptions due to obstructive apneas. Patients with primary snoring revealed peak intensities between 100 and 300 Hz. Patients with an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) revealed peak intensities above 1,000 Hz. Polysomnographical data (AHI, mean and minimum SpO(2)) as well as body mass index (BMI) correlated with peak intensity of the power spectrum. None of the parameters of the clinical examination correlated with peak intensity. Frequency analysis of snoring sounds provides a useful diagnostic tool to distinguish between different patterns of snoring and respective SDB. The topodiagnosis of snoring is not possible by means of frequency analysis or clinical examination alone.

AB  - Two different spectral analyses of heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) were performed on seven young male subjects to evaluate the effects of different color temperatures of light exposure (6700 K, 5000 K, 3000 K) before sleep on cardiac vagal activity. In investigating HRV, we used an ordinary fast Fourier transform (FFT) and coarse graining spectral analysis (CGSA), which selectively extracts random fractal components from a given time series. The results showed that suppressions of HR during sleep after 6700 K light exposure were more inhibited than the other two lighting conditions. Increases in high-frequency (HF) components of HRV during sleep were also inhibited by 6700 K pre-sleep lighting. These results indicate that pre-sleep exposure to light of a higher color temperature may inhibit the enhancement of cardiac vagal activity during sleep. Moreover, significant HF alterations were shown in fractal-free HF (not in ordinary HF) components by CGSA. Because the HF component originates from respiratory sinus arrhythmia with periodical fluctuations, CGSA may be an appropriate approach for HRV evaluation during sleep Two different spectral analyses of heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) were performed on seven young male subjects to evaluate the effects of different color temperatures of light exposure (6700 K, 5000 K, 3000 K) before sleep on cardiac vagal activity.

AB  - AIMS: To analyze the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) attended with the mental load arising while solving two cognitive tasks. The features of the presented visual stimulus determined the type of cognitive task that should be solved. METHODS: For each experimental task and everybody's subject FFT Analysis module calculated the total power histograms from a fixed frequency band (3-20 Hz or 8-13 Hz) for each 3-second EEG sample with 50 % overlay and all electrodes. From the histograms the software derived two FFT single values--the average Total Power (TP) and Frequency at Maximum Power (FMP). RESULTS: It has been shown that during the solution of cognitive tasks the marked changes of ongoing EEG activity appeared. The short lasting and localized amplitude decrease in rhythmic activity (ERD) and the change of EEG frequency were among the most frequent. The ERD extent was determined by an informational content of processed visual stimuli and by the site of scalp-recording electrode. A higher mental load related to the solution of cognitive tasks shifted the average FM to lower frequencies. CONCLUSION: The suitability of an analysis of ongoing EEG activity to uncover differences in people's brain activation patterns when engaged in performing cognitively demanding tasks was proved AIMS: To analyze the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) attended with the mental load arising while solving two cognitive tasks.

AB  - This review synthesized findings from 17 studies since 1998 regarding evaluation of outpatient treatments for adolescent substance abuse. These studies represented systematic design advances in adolescent clinical trial science. The research examined 46 different intervention conditions with a total sample of 2,307 adolescents. The sample included 7 individual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) replications (n = 367), 13 group CBT replications (n = 771), 17 family therapy replications (n = 850) and 9 minimal treatment control conditions (n = 319). The total sample was composed of approximately 75% males, and the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 45% White, 25% Hispanic, 25% African American, and 5% other groups. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate within-group effect sizes as well as differences between active treatment conditions and the minimal treatment control conditions. Methodological rigor of studies was classified using Nathan and Gorman (2002) criteria, and treatments were classified using criteria for well-established and probably efficacious interventions based on Chambless et al. (1996). Three treatment approaches, multidimensional family therapy, functional family therapy, and group CBT emerged as well-established models for substance abuse treatment. However, a number of other models are probably efficacious, and none of the treatment approaches appeared to be clearly superior to any others in terms of treatment effectiveness for adolescent substance abuse.

AB  - A cDNA sequence encoding a soluble form of the human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) was produced by RT-PCR amplification. This form of the receptor contains the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, the EGF homology domain, and the serine/threonine-rich domain, but lacks the membrane anchor as well as the cytoplasmic domain. By the same technical approach a cDNA sequence encoding rabbit transferrin was generated. In-frame fusion of the two cDNAs produced a sequence encoding a chimeric protein potentially capable of binding LDL on the N-terminal side and the transferrin receptor on the C-terminal side. It was expected that LDL bound to the chimeric protein could be internalized, targeted to an acidic compartment, and processed through the pathway of the transferrin receptor. Cells transfected with the LDL-R/transferrin cDNA translate, glycosylate, and secrete the corresponding protein in the culture medium. The secreted protein binds LDL in a ligand-blotting experiment. Finally, the chimeric protein mediates the binding and internalization of LDL in mutant cells lacking the LDL receptor. In fact, Watanabe rabbit fibroblasts, incubated with the chimeric protein show a fourfold increase in LDL binding, a fivefold increase in LDL internalization, and a sixfold increase in LDL degradation, with respect to unincubated fibroblasts A cDNA sequence encoding a soluble form of the human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) was produced by RT-PCR amplification.

AB  - To deal with the problem of multiuser scheduling schemes in MIMO broadcast channels, a new algorithm based on FFT codebooks is presented for the determining of active users. In this algorithm, users are divided into different groups belonging to different quantized channel regions, and then the active user group is selected by semi-orthogonal property among the channel regions. Simulation results show that the presented algorithm can get higher sum rates than SUS and it can greatly reduced the computing complexity when the number of users is large at the same time.

To deal with the problem of multiuser scheduling schemes in MIMO broadcast channels, a new algorithm based on FFT codebooks is presented for the determining of active users. In this algorithm, users are divided into different groups belonging to different quantized channel regions, and then the active user group is selected by semi-orthogonal property among the channel regions. Simulation results show that the presented algorithm can get higher sum rates than SUS and it can greatly reduced the computing complexity when the number of users is large at the same time. It can be conduded that the new algorithm is beneficial in terms of increasing the system throughput as well as decreasing the complexity of multiuser scheduling.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the identities of eight women who share similar demographic profiles but exhibit different language practices. These middle-aged and older women belong to two social groups which, we argue, constitute two communities of practice within a small black Appalachian community in the Southern United States. From interview data, we analyze six diagnostic sociolinguistic variables (third singular -s absence, copula absence, rhoticity, consonant cluster reduction, habitual be) and also examine productions of /u/ and /o/. The groups differ significantly in their use of the morphosyntactic and syntactic variables and in their vowel productions, but not the consonantal features. Combining our quantitative findings with qualitative data, we suggest language is one of several vehicles the women use to transmit symbolic messages to others and thereby construct identities for themselves and their groups, whose members adhere to different language ideologies, religious norms, notions of feminine decorum, and educational standards.

This paper describes the experience of Chinese battered women in North America and provides suggestions for culturally sensitive and competent interventions for them. The discussion is based on an extensive review of the literature regarding Chinese battered women. In understanding the experience of Chinese battered women and their strategic responses to the abuse, helping professionals are urged to consider cultural, contextual, as well as individual factors including family dynamics.

AB  - Background: Experimental and clinical studies postulate a neurobiological mechanism of acupuncture by modulating central pain systems, neurohormones and -transmitters. It seems to be quite likely that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important mediating role in this neuromodulation. Aim: In measuring heart rate variability (HRV), as a non-invasive approach to the ANS-function, the object of this study was to monitor probable acupuncture-induced changes of autonomic balance. The innovative technology of laser-needle acupuncture offers for the first time a stimulation method which fulfils the demands on a placebo-controlled acupuncture trial not requiring controversial sham acupuncture. Method: 19 healthy voluntary subjects underwent 3 treatments in randomized sequence, consisting of placebo-, 1-point- (PC 6) and simultaneous 3-point- (PC 6, LR 3, SI 3) laser-needle-stimulation over 20 minutes. Before, during and after placebo-/verum laser-needle acupuncture, HRV-data for normalized HF(high frequency)- and LF(low frequency)-Power (nHF, nLF) and their quotient nLF/nHF obtained by power spectrum analysis (FFT), were measured and analyzed statistically at 5 different time points (ANOVA repeated measures, p < 0,05). Results: During both verum applications, the 1-point- (PC 6) as well as the simultaneous 3-point- (PC 6, LR 3, SI 3) laser-needle stimulation, significant changes of the ANS-activity were found in comparison to the placebo application. The most significant modification of HRV was an increase of nHF (p < 0,05 (PC 6), p < 0,0001 (PC 6, LR 3, SI 3)) as an expression of growing vagal activity during acupuncture. Conclusion: Laser-needle acupuncture causes in 1-point-stimulation (PC 6) as well as in simultaneous 3-point-stimulation (PC 6, LR 3, SI 3) significant changes in HRV in comparison to placebo application. HRV-monitoring seems to be a suitable approach in exploration of acupuncture-induced changes of ANS and could possibly be established in combination with laser needle acupuncture as a standard for further scientific and clinical acupuncture investigations which are greatly needed Background: Experimental and clinical studies postulate a neurobiological mechanism of acupuncture by modulating central pain systems, neurohormones and -transmitters.

AB  - This study investigated social skills deficits among adolescents with bipolar disorder (n = 18) as compared with a control group of adolescents (n = 18) free from major psychiatric disturbance. We hypothesized that symptom-free bipolar adolescents would be indistinguishable from controls on ratings of social skills knowledge, but would exhibit significant social skills performance deficits relative to controls. Axis I diagnoses for bipolar patients were determined via the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) during recruitment for a pilot study of Family-Focused Therapy for Adolescents (FFT-A), a modified version of Miklowitz & Goldstein's (1997) family-focused intervention for adults with bipolar disorder. Bipolar participants completed social skills assessments when they were experiencing minimal symptoms. The control group consisted of individuals who responded to advertisements requesting participation from teens not diagnosed with psychological disturbance. These teens were subsequently screened for psychopathology using the K-SADS-PL. To assess social skills performance assets and deficits, participants completed the Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters (MESSY), a self-report scale that requires subjects to rate the frequency of various prosocial behaviors. The teen's parent or guardian simultaneously completed the T-MESSY (teacher/parent rated version). Knowledge of appropriate social skills was measured using the Interpersonal Negotiation Strategy Interview (INS), a structured interview that asks participants to formulate solutions to hypothetical social dilemmas. Raters blind to psychiatric condition rated the participant's responses, as well as his/her social interactions with the examiner during the assessment using the Interactional Skills Ratings (ISR) scale. In line with our hypotheses, bipolar adolescents exhibited age-appropriate knowledge of social skills during a period of symptom remission, but displayed more social skills performance deficits on both self- and parent-rated assessments than controls. Bipolar participants were indistinguishable from controls on blinded ratings of interactions with the examiner. Implications of the findings for biological models of the onset of bipolar disorder, and psychosocial interventions are discussed.

AB  - Comments on an article by DJ Miklowitz et al. (see record 2008-18377-007). the authors present results of a 2-year randomized trial on family-focused treatment for adolescents with bipolar disorder (FFT-A). They conclude that FFT-A is effective in stabilizing bipolar depressive symptoms among adolescents. Unfortunately, however, the report lacks important information necessary to assess the actual efficacy of the intervention because Miklowitz et al. did not report the exact number of subjects per group who entered the study in a syndromally depressed state. Accordingly, recovery rates from initial depressive symptoms should correspond to the subgroups of patients who entered the study syndromally depressed and not to the total number of subjects per group. Finally, Miklowitz et al. colleagues failed to report a significance test for the group difference in depression-free weeks for the sub-sample of patients entering the study in a syndromally depressed state. Delineation of this information is important, particularly because of the overall small sample sizes in this study.

AB  - Most studies of sustained attention performance obscure the presence and pattern of lapses by reporting measures that are summed across the entire period of an individual's performance, or that are average scores for blocks of trials across many participants. In the present study we attempted to explore fluctuation in the attention of individual participants over the course of a vigilance task and to quantify its periodicity, if any exists. Normal university students listened to letters of the alphabet, arranged randomly and presented at a rate of 2 per second for 20 min. They were instructed to press a hand-held button when they detected a target (two consecutive identical letters). Continuous estimates of performance accuracy (correctly detected targets) at regularly spaced time intervals were created for each participant using a moving time window. The resulting functions were analyzed in order to detect and quantify periodicity using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The most often observed rhythms for those participants with adequate FFT power congregated at 1-2 min, 4-7 min and greater than 10 min. Performance functions from 36 of the 40 subjects displayed at least two of these frequencies.

AB  - This paper presents the development of structural dynamic equations of motion for a 3-PRR parallel manipulator with three flexible intermediate links, based on the assumed mode method. Lagrange's equation is used to derive the dynamic model of the manipulator system. Flexible intermediate links are modeled as Euler--Bernoulli beams with pinned--pinned boundary conditions. Dynamic equations of motion of a 3-PRR parallel manipulator with three flexible links are developed by adopting the assumed mode method. The effect of concentrated rotational inertia at both ends of intermediate links is included in this model. Numerical simulations of vibration responses, coupling forces and inertial forces are presented. The corresponding frequency spectra analysis is performed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental modal tests are performed to validate the theoretical model through comparison and analysis of modal characteristics of the flexible manipulator system.

AB  - Parents of autistic children face enormous challenges, but very little attention has been paid to their psychological needs. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has previously been tested with parents as part of a comprehensive package, but not yet alone. The present study used a within-subject, repeated measures design to test the effects of a 2-day ( 14 hour) group ACT workshop on 20 normal parents/guardians of children diagnosed with autism. Parents were assessed three weeks before the workshop, one week before, one week after, and three months after. No significant change occurred while waiting for treatment, but pre to post improvements were found on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Significant pre to follow-up improvements were observed on the BDI-II, BSI, and the General Health Questionnaire- 12. Processes measures of experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion also changed and there was some evidence that these changes mediated outcomes seen. Results suggest that ACT may have promise in helping parents better adjust to the difficulties in raising children diagnosed with autism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term drug treatment of schizophrenia with typical antipsychotic drugs has limitations: 25 to 33% of sufferers have illnesses that are treatment resistant. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug, which is claimed to have superior efficacy and to cause fewer motor adverse effects than typical drugs for people with treatment-resistant illnesses. Clozapine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders, which necessitates mandatory weekly blood monitoring at least during the first months of treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of clozapine compared with typical antipsychotic drugs in people with schizophrenia. SEARCH STRATEGY: For the current update of this review (November 2008) we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: We have included 52 trials (4746 participants) in this review. Forty-four of the included studies are less than 13 weeks in duration, and, overall, trials were at a significant risk of bias. We found no significant difference in the effects of clozapine and typical neuroleptic drugs for broad outcomes such as mortality, ability to work or suitability for discharge at the end of the study. Clinical improvements were seen more frequently in those taking clozapine (n=1119, 14 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 6 CI 5 to 8). Also, participants given clozapine had fewer relapses than those on typical antipsychotic drugs (n=1303, RR 0.62 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 21 CI 15 to 49). BPRS scores showed a greater reduction of symptoms in clozapine-treated participants, (n=1205, 17 RCTs, WMD -3.79 CI -4.9 to -2.7), although the data were heterogeneous ( I2=69%). Short-term data from the SANS negative symptom scores favoured clozapine (n=196, 6 RCTs, WMD -7.21 CI -8.9 to -5.6). We found clozapine to be more acceptable in long-term treatment than conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=982, 6 RCTs, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 15 CI 12 to 20). Blood problems occurred more frequently in participants receiving clozapine (3.2%) compared with those given typical antipsychotic drugs (0%) (n=1031, 13 RCTs, RR 7.09 CI 2.0 to 25.6). Clozapine participants experienced more drowsiness, hypersalivation or temperature increase, than those given conventional neuroleptics. However, those receiving clozapine experienced fewer motor adverse effects (n=1495, 19 RCTs, RR 0.57 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6).The clinical effects of clozapine were more pronounced in participants resistant to typical neuroleptics in terms of clinical improvement (n=370, 4 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 4 CI 3 to 6) and symptom reduction. Thirty-four per cent of treatment-resistant participants had a clinical improvement with clozapine treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine may be more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, producing clinically meaningful improvements and postponing relapse, than typical antipsychotic drugs - but data are weak and prone to bias. Participants were more satisfied with clozapine treatment than with typical neuroleptic treatment. The clinical effect of clozapine, however, is, at least in the short-term, not reflected in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation. The short-term benefits of clozapine have to be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age.The existing trials have largely neglected to assess the views of participants and their families on clozapine. More community-based long-term randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of clozapine on global and social functioning as trials in special groups such as people with learning disabilities. CLOZAPINE VERSUS TYPICAL NEUROLEPTIC MEDICATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic and relapsing mental illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. Schizophrenia is characterised by 'positive' symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and 'negative' symptoms such as emotional numbness and withdrawal. One quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. Half do have a recurrent illness but with long episodes of considerable recovery from the positive symptoms. The overall cost of the illness to the individual, their carers and the community is considerable.Antipsychotic medications are classified into typical and atypical drugs. First generation or 'typical' antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment, and are effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but negative symptoms are fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with adverse effects which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse.People who do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication are sometimes given the 'atypical' antipsychotic drug clozapine, which has been found to be effective for some people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine is also associated with having fewer movement disorders than chlorpromazine, but may induce life-threatening decreases in white blood cells (agranulocytosis). We reviewed the affects of clozapine in people with schizophrenia compared with typical antipsychotic drugs drugs.This review supports the notion that clozapine is more effective than typical antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia in general, and for those who do not improve on typical antipsychotic drugs in particular. Clozapine is associated with less movement adverse effects than typical antipsychotic drugs, but it may cause serious blood-related adverse effects. White blood cell count monitoring is mandatory for all people taking clozapine. There is a worry, however, that studies are - at the very least - moderately prone to bias favouring clozapine. Better conduct and reporting of trials could greatly have increased our confidence in the results BACKGROUND: Long-term drug treatment of schizophrenia with typical antipsychotic drugs has limitations: 25 to 33% of sufferers have illnesses that are treatment resistant.

AB  - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an empirically supported treatment for conduct-disordered young children in which parents learn the skills of child-directed interaction (CDI) in the first phase of treatment and parent-directed interaction (PDI) in the second. This study examined the long-term treatment outcome for 13 families who had participated in a treatment study examining the effects of treatment phase sequence one and two years earlier. Seven families were in the CDI-First treatment group and six families were in the PDI-First group. Immediately after treatment, 11 of the 13 families had achieved clinically significant changes on both observational and parent report measures, and there is no significant difference between treatment groups. Treatment effects were maintained at one-year follow-up for eight of the 13 families, and at two-year follow-up for nine families, with no long- term impact of phase sequence evident at either follow-up assessment. This study represents the first long-term follow-up of families treated with PCIT. Results suggest that this treatment may be successful in achieving long-term gains for most families of conduct-disordered preschoolers and that phase sequence has little impact on treatment outcome.

Fathers and mothers consistently reported fathers<ef><bf><bd>_T improved coparenting behavior when the coparenting intervention was compared with a no-intervention control group ( n = 64). Fathers (regardless of residence) and mothers residing with the father reported higher levels of fathers<ef><bf><bd>_T engagement with the infant when the father participated in the coparenting intervention compared with fathers who participated in the childbirth intervention.

Therapists can use the SPFF to understand and integrate existing models of family therapy and to create their own personal models of family therapy. The SPFF framework highlights the interrelationships among the four generic models which dominate the field of family therapy.

It has been noted that in working with the Shenzhen youths with eating disorder, the therapist's admission of her limited knowledge of the Shenzhen culture, its social norms and behaviours, the spoken dialects, and her readiness to learn more in these areas is extremely crucial.

AB  - The impact of multiple-family group treatment (MFGT) on outpatient and inpatient mental health service utilization of 97 persons with schizophrenia was investigated. Participants were randomly assigned to standard care ( n=44) or standard care plus MFGT ( n=53). Service use for a year prior to randomization, the 2-year study period, and a 1-year follow-up were examined. Relative to standard care participants, the MFGT group had reduced community hospitalization during year 1 of the intervention and reduced state hospitalization at follow-up. During the intervention period, MFGT participants demonstrated a significant increase in outpatient utilization as a direct consequence of the intervention. However, when service use was summed across 3 years post-randomization, no group differences were observed. Results suggest that implementation of MFGT in a community mental health setting reduces inpatient service at specific time periods, without significantly increasing outpatient service utilization. These findings add to other outcomes from this study that demonstrate decreased psychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress.

AB  - This paper argues for the importance of adopting a population-level approach to promote more effective parenting and to reduce the risk of child maltreatment. Family-based interventions based on social learning principles have been shown to make a useful contribution in the treatment of child maltreatment. However, typically such programmes have been used to treat parents who have already become involved in the child protection system. We argue that the creation of community-wide support structures to support positive parenting is needed to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment. Such an approach requires several criteria to be met. These include having knowledge about the prevalence rates for the targeted child outcomes sought, knowledge about the prevalence of various parenting and family risk factors, evidence that changing family risk factors reduces the prevalence of targeted problems, having culturally appropriate, cost-effective, evidence-based interventions available and making these widely accessible.

AB  - New analyses of archival data from a parent training study are presented for ten troubled mother-child dyads. All the mothers participated in verbal discourse sessions with their clinicians during the same weeks in which they participated in clinic-based parent training. The discourse was guided by clinicians to focus mothers on their narratives of parenting problems; five mothers were prompted to restructure their stories in order to improve story coherence, while the other five were simply prompted to continue their stories. All stories were rated for clarity and credibility and mother-child interactions were measured in the dyads' home settings. Results show that the restructuring process led these mothers to tell more credible stories than did the control group mothers. Home observations also showed that the former group followed the parent training protocol, while the latter group did not. In addition, correlations between mothers' narrative credibility scores and home indices of mother-child improvement suggest that the narrative restructuring procedure might have enhanced mothers' parent training performance.

AB  - The number of children and adolescents in the United States requiring care for emotional and behavioral problems is a major public health concern. Increased attention to the limitations of current social service systems to meet the needs of this population led to the development and administration of an innovative outpatient Intensive Home-Based (IHB) treatment program for youth who would typically be placed in hospital or residential care. In this effectiveness study, we examined (1) demographic and clinical characteristics of (N = 48) enrolled youth, (2) determined changes in skills, behaviors, self-esteem, and therapeutic involvement of the clients between intake and a three-month follow-up, (3) examined changes in the skills and behaviors of the parent/caregiver of the child between intake and a three-month follow-up, and (4) calculated the costs of IHB treatment and compared with costs of alternative treatments available in the same community. Results indicated positive outcomes on almost all measures indicated the program's effectiveness, particularly in light of the reduced cost of IHB treatment when compared with hospital or residential care.

AB  - In recent years, there has been much discussion of the efficacy of mental health interventions for children as well as the transportation of empirically-supported treatments (ESTs) to field settings. A logical initial step in this line of research is to examine whether the efficacy of ESTs can be demonstrated in community settings such as in the home environment. The purpose of the study was to examine the efficacy of an in-home Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) program using a single-subject, A/B design across five subjects with staggered baselines. Decreases in caregiver use of negative behavior and caregiver-reported child behavior problems were observed for the three families that completed treatment. In addition, completers demonstrated increases in child compliance, caregiver use of positive behavior, and contingent praise. Data regarding caregivers' reported parenting stress and caregiver proportion of direct commands were less convincing. All three dyads completing treatment reported satisfaction with the intervention. Clinical implications regarding the possible benefits of PCIT for improving the effectiveness of home visiting programs are discussed as well as directions for future research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The current study examined whether callous-unemotional (CU) traits moderated the effectiveness of Functional Family Therapy for juvenile justice involved adolescents. METHOD Participants were all youths ( n = 134) who had been arrested and participated in an FFT program provided in a community mental health center over a 20-month period (mean age 15.34, 71.6% males, 59% African-American). Parent and self-report ratings of emotional, behavioral, and social functioning, multi-informant ratings of treatment progress, and probation/arrest records were used as outcome indicators. RESULTS CU traits were associated with poorer behavioral, emotional, and social adjustment prior to treatment but they were also associated with greater improvements in adjustment over the course of treatment. CU traits were not associated with significantly lower rates of participation or higher rates of treatment dropout, and the association between CU traits and risk for violent charges decreased after treatment at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. However, CU traits were still correlated with poorer levels of adjustment post-treatment, less perceived change over treatment by youth and their parents, and increased likelihood of violent offending during treatment. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that FFT can lead to improvements in youth with CU traits; however, they enter treatment with a greater number of symptoms and are at higher risk for committing violence during treatment than other youth.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Our ongoing longitudinal study has shown that NREM delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) power measured at C3 and C4 decrease by more than 60% between ages 11 and 17 years. Here, we investigate the age trajectories of delta and theta power at frontal, central, and occipital electrodes DESIGN: Baseline sleep EEG was recorded twice yearly for 6 years in 2 cohorts, spanning ages 9-18 years, with overlap at 12-15 years SETTING: Sleep EEG was recorded in the subjects' homes with ambulatory recorders PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven subjects in 2 cohorts, one starting at age 9 (n = 30) and one at age 12 years (n = 37) MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep EEG recorded from Fz, Cz, C3, C4, and O1 was referred to mastoids. Visual scoring and artifact elimination was followed by FFT power analysis. Delta and theta EEG power declined steeply across this age range. The maturational trajectories of delta power showed a "back to front" pattern, with O1 delta power declining earliest and Fz delta power declining latest. Theta EEG power did not show this topographic difference in the timing of its decline. Delta, and to a lesser extent, theta power became frontally dominant in early adolescence CONCLUSIONS: We maintain our interpretation that the adolescent decline in EEG power reflects a widespread brain reorganization driven by synaptic pruning. The late decline in frontally recorded delta power indicates that plasticity is maintained in these circuits until a later age. Although delta and theta have similar homeostatic properties, they have different age and topographic patterns that imply different functional correlates STUDY OBJECTIVES: Our ongoing longitudinal study has shown that NREM delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) power measured at C3 and C4 decrease by more than 60% between ages 11 and 17 years.

AB  - An algorithm based only on the impedance cardiogram (ICG) recorded through two defibrillation pads, using the strongest frequency component and amplitude, incorporated into a defibrillator could determine circulatory arrest and reduce delays in starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Frequency analysis of the ICG signal is carried out by integer filters on a sample by sample basis. They are simpler, lighter and more versatile when compared to the FFT. This alternative approach, although less accurate, is preferred due to the limited processing capacity of devices that could compromise real time usability of the FFT. These two techniques were compared across a data set comprising 13 cases of cardiac arrest and 6 normal controls. The best filters were refined on this training set and an algorithm for the detection of cardiac arrest was trained on a wider data set. The algorithm was finally tested on a validation set. The ICG was recorded in 132 cardiac arrest patients (53 training, 79 validation) and 97 controls (47 training, 50 validation): the diagnostic algorithm indicated cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 81.1% (77.6-84.3) and specificity of 97.1% (96.7-97.4) for the validation set (95% confidence intervals).

AB  - This paper discusses the development of a constant-Q spectrogram representation that is invertible in a least-squares sense. A good quality inverse is possible because this modified transform method, unlike the usual sliding window constant-Q spectrogram, does not discard data samples when performing the variable length discrete Fourier transforms on the signal. The development of a phase vocoder application using this modified technique is also discussed. It is shown that a phase vocoder constructed using the least-squares invertible constant-Q spectrogram (LSICQS) is not a trivial extension of the regular FFT-based phase vocoder algorithm and some of the mathematical subtleties related to phase reassignment are addressed This paper discusses the development of a constant-Q spectrogram representation that is invertible in a least-squares sense.

AB  - The incidence of stroke is high in Brazil and in the whole world. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular autonomic modulation of chronic ischemic stroke patients. Seventeen men and women separated in stroke (SG; n=10; 56+/-2years old; 164+/-2cm height; 68+/-3kg weight) and control group (CG; n=7; 51 +/-5years old; 168+/-1cm height; 64+/-4kg weight) were evaluated. The SG group (5+/-1years after stroke) was under pharmacological treatment (ACE inhibitor, simvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid). Blood pressure (BP) was recorded continuously (Finometer) during 15 minutes. The heart rate variability (HRV)and the BP variability were analyzed in time and frequency domains (FFT). The SG presented similar systolic (SBP: 123+/-6 vs. 110+/-3 mmHg) and diastolic BP(DBP: 82 +/-6 vs. 75+/-1 mmHg) as well as heart rate (72 +/-5 vs. 70+/-3bpm) as compared to CG. The RR variance (544+/-197 vs. 1714+/-232 ms<sup>2</sup>) was decreased in SG as compared to CG. SBP variance (57+/-13 vs. 22+/-6 mmHg<sup>2</sup>) and LF of SBP (6.8+/-1.4 vs. 2.8+/-0.8 mmHg<sup>2</sup>) were increased in SG as compared to CG. In conclusion, these results suggest that subjects after ischemic stroke present chronically impairment of cardiovascular autonomic modulation, suggesting higher cardiovascular risk despite normal clinical blood pressure The incidence of stroke is high in Brazil and in the whole world. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular autonomic modulation of chronic ischemic stroke patients. Seventeen men and women separated in stroke (SG; n=10; 56+/-2years old; 164+/-2cm height; 68+/-3kg weight) and control group (CG; n=7; 51 +/-5years old; 168+/-1cm height; 64+/-4kg weight) were evaluated. The SG group (5+/-1years after stroke) was under pharmacological treatment (ACE inhibitor, simvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid). Blood pressure (BP) was recorded continuously (Finometer) during 15 minutes. The heart rate variability (HRV)and the BP variability were analyzed in time and frequency domains (FFT). The SG presented similar systolic (SBP: 123+/-6 vs. 110+/-3 mmHg) and diastolic BP(DBP: 82 +/-6 vs. 75+/-1 mmHg) as well as heart rate (72 +/-5 vs. 70+/-3bpm) as compared to CG. The RR variance (544+/-197 vs. 1714+/-232 ms<sup>2</sup>) was decreased in SG as compared to CG. SBP variance (57+/-13 vs. 22+/-6 mmHg<sup>2</sup>) and LF of SBP (6.8+/-1.4 vs. 2.8+/-0.8 mmHg<sup>2</sup>) were increased in SG as compared to CG. In conclusion, these results suggest that subjects after ischemic stroke present chronically impairment of cardiovascular autonomic modulation, suggesting higher cardiovascular risk despite normal clinical blood pressure

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether diabetic patients who were depressed present a decrease of brain serotonergic activity compared to diabetic patients without depression or patients with depression but without diabetes. Determination was made with plasma free fraction of l-tryptophan (FFT) and intensity-dependent auditoryevoked potentials (IDAEPs). Methods: Thirty seven adolescents were studied (20 type 1 diabetic subjects: 9 with depression, 11 without depression), 9 controls and 8 subjects with only depression. FFT, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, free fatty acids, albumin and IDAEPs were determined. Result: All diabetic patients showed a significant decrease of FFT. The group diabetic subjects with depression presented a steeper slope of the amplitude-intensity function of N1/P2 component, suggesting a higher reactivity of the auditory cortex in comparison to diabetic subjects without depression, subjects with only depression, and controls. This was associated with lower plasma FFT. Diabetic subjects with depression had a deficiency of metabolic control due to poor treatment adherence. Conclusions: These findings suggest an enhanced deterioration of brain serotonergic neurotransmission in diabetic subjects with depression with abnormal responses of the auditory cortex. The N1/P2 component of IDAEP is proposed as a noninvasive indicator of brain serotonergic tone that differentiates depressed from nondepressed diabetic patients Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether diabetic patients who were depressed present a decrease of brain serotonergic activity compared to diabetic patients without depression or patients with depression but without diabetes.

AB  - Introduction.- Sustained attention is a fundamental executive function. Previous evidence suggests frail older people perform poorly on tasks that place a higher demand on resources of attention. We investigated whether increasing sustained attention variabilitywas associated with frailty in a population representative sample of adults aged>=50 years using the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Text.- Four thousand seven hundred and eighty-five participants of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) completed a comprehensive health assessment. Frailty was defined by having>= 3 of low gait speed, low grip strength, unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion and low physical activity. Mean and variability of reaction time (RT), commission and omission errors were recorded during a fixed-SART. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) procedurewasused to characterise variability associated with the arousal and vigilance aspects of sustained attention. Among the Irish population>=50 years of age, 3.7% were frail and 35.3% were pre-frail. Non-frail participants had significantly less RT variability (P < 0.001), and fewer commission (P < 0.001) and omission (P < 0.001) errors than their pre-frail and frail counterparts. Regression analyses, adjusted for age and gender, revealed variability associated with the vigilance aspect of sustained attention was strongly associated with pre-frailty (P < 0.001: OR= 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06-1.15) and frailty (P < 0.001: OR= 1.21, 95% CI: 1.13-1.30). Variability associated with the arousal aspect also increased the risk of pre-frailty (p < 0.05: OR= 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) and frailty (P < 0.05: OR= 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.13). Greater sustained attention variability was strongly associated with pre-frailty and frailty. It may provide a novel cognitive marker for identifying frailty risk, enabling early detection and the provision of intervention strategies Introduction.- Sustained attention is a fundamental executive function.

AB  - A major cause of the well-documented inadequacy of pain treatment is the in ability to assess pain. Current pain quantification relies on patient reporting which is subjective, inconsistent and even impossible in many patient populations. The purpose of this project is to apply feature extraction to Electroencephalograph (EEG) in efforts to elucidate data that is highly correlated with pain state towards the future development of a pattern recognition system for pain quantification. EEG data was collected from human subjects during Cold Pressor (CP) pain, an Arithmetic Control (AC), Pain Anticipation (PA) control and a muscle artifact control (WINCE). Feature extraction techniques were investigated via scalp topographies verified with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Frequency-based features included Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Mean-Frequency. Alpha1/2 had an artifact-free temporo-parietal decrease contralateral to stimulus with pain suggesting pain related activation of the parietal operculum/insula and occipital increase likely due to decreased visual activity. The Theta band had a fronto-central decrease that could indicate either a pain-related activation of the anterior cingulate cortex or a pain-irrelevant change in working memory load. The mean-frequency feature showed a generalized increase with pain but will result from non-pain conditions as well. Gamma-1 and Beta-2 wavelet variability showed a decrease in some regions with pain, however these changes appear to due to muscle artifact. Alpha-1/2 and Theta bands showed an artifact-free contralateral-temporal increase in CP-control which shows promise as a pain metric. Several complexity based features were investigated as well. ARMO showed an artifact free decrease for with pain in frontal and occipital. SE using FFT showed an increase in CP-controls for all electrodes while WINCE-controls had a global decrease. ApEn also resulted in an increase in CP-controls for all electrodes, but some muscle artifact. AutoRegressive Models were computed for orders 1<ef><bf><bd>_"25 and 50 with the <ef><bf><bd>_~a<ef><bf><bd>_T values of each order being considered as features. Visual inspection of these <ef><bf><bd>_~a<ef><bf><bd>_T values show a variety of topographies with either high correlation between pain and wince comparisons or topographies with generalized results.

AB  - Objectives: Daytime dysfunction and quality of life impairment are important and salient consequences of poor sleep in those with insomnia. Existing measurement approaches to functional impact tend to rely on non-specific generic tools, non-validated scales, or ad hoc single scale items. Here we report the development and validation of the Glasgow Sleep Impact Index (GSII), a novel self-report measure which asks patients to generate, and assess, three domains of impairment unique to their own individual context. These three patient-generated areas of impairment are ranked in order of concern (1-3; i.e. 1 = the most concerning impairment), and then rated on a visual analogue scale with respect to impact in the past two weeks. Patients re-rate these specified areas of impairment, post-intervention, permitting both individual and group-level analyses. Methods: One-hundred and eight patients (71% female; Mean age = 45 yrs) meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for Insomnia Disorder completed the GSII, resulting in the generation of 324 areas (ranks) of sleep-related daytime and quality of life impairment. Fifty-five patients also completed the GSII pre and post-sleep restriction therapy. The following psychometric properties were assessed: content validity of generated domains; relationship between ranks of impairment; and sensitivity to change post-behavioural intervention. Results: Content analysis of generated domains support recent DSM-5 proposals for specification of daytime consequences of insomnia; with the most commonly cited areas reflecting impairments in energy/motivation, work performance, cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, health/well-being, social functioning and relationship/family functioning. Preliminary results with 108 patients indicate the GSII to have excellent face and construct validity. The GSII was found to be sensitive to change, post-behavioural treatment (p < 0.001; Cohen's d >= 0.85 for all three ranks of impairment), and improvements were associated with reductions in insomnia severity in both correlational (range of r = 0.28-0.56) and responder versus non-responder analyses (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: The development of the GSII represents a novel attempt to capture and measure sleep-related quality of life impairment in a valid and meaningful way. Further psychometric and clinical evaluation is suggested. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Partial and non-adherence to medication is a common problem in schizophrenia, leading to an increased risk of relapse, increased likelihood of hospitalization and poorer long-term outcomes. In contrast, continuous medication in the treatment of schizophrenia is associated with positive outcomes, including improved clinical status, improved quality of life and functioning, and reduced risk of relapse and rehospitalization. Strategies aimed at improving medication adherence are therefore key for patients to achieve their treatment goals. In an attempt to address the issues of partial/non-adherence to antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia, a group of psychiatrists convened to discuss and develop a set of principles aimed at helping patients adhere to their medication. These principles were then refined and developed into the STAY (the Six principles to improve Treatment Adherence in Your patients) initiative following presentation to a wider group of psychiatrists from across Europe. This manuscript summarizes these principles and explains the rationale for their selection. These principles are: (1) recognizing that most patients with schizophrenia are at risk of partial/non-adherence at some time during the course of their illness; (2) the benefits of a good therapeutic alliance for identifying potential adherence issues; (3) tailored treatment plans to meet an individual's needs, including the most suitable route of delivery of antipsychotic medication; (4) involving family/key persons in care and psychoeducation of the patient, assuming the patient agrees to this; (5) ensuring optimal effectiveness of care; and (6) ensuring continuity in the care of patients with schizophrenia. The application of these six principles should help to raise awareness of and address poor patient adherence, as well as generally improving care of patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Among patients with cancer, the management of depression is very important to improve quality of life as well as distress. Because the efficacy of escitalopram, a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has not been well evaluated in cancer patients, we investigated its effects on depression and quality of life in outpatients with breast cancer. Methods: A 12-week, open-label, prospective study with escitalopram (5-20 mg/day) was performed in 79 breast cancer outpatients with depression. The primary outcome was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), which was administered at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), MD Anderson Symptoms Inventory (MDASI), Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Distress Thermometer (DT) were also used to measure improvement in symptoms, distress, and quality of life. Results: Compared to baseline, HAMD, DT, and CGI-S scores were significantly decreased at week 1 and onwards, and FACT-B and MDSAI were improved at week 2 and onwards. At the end point (week 12), all FACT-B subscales including the physical, emotional, social/family, functional well-being, and the breast cancer subscales were improved. Improvement in distress and quality of life was associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Of all participants, 45.1% met the response criterion (at least a 50% decrease in HAMD total score), and 30.6% met the remission criterion (HAMD total score <= 7) at week 12. Conclusions: In the present study, escitalopram improved quality of life and reduced depression in breast cancer patients. Symptoms rapidly improved within 1 week, influencing quality of life. Escitalopram may be an effective treatment of depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), MD Anderson Symptoms Inventory (MDASI), Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Distress Thermometer (DT) were also used to measure improvement in symptoms, distress, and quality of life. Results: Compared to baseline, HAMD, DT, and CGI-S scores were significantly decreased at week 1 and onwards, and FACT-B and MDSAI were improved at week 2 and onwards. At the end point (week 12), all FACT-B subscales including the physical, emotional, social/family, functional well-being, and the breast cancer subscales were improved. Improvement in distress and quality of life was associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Of all participants, 45.1% met the response criterion (at least a 50% decrease in HAMD total score), and 30.6% met the remission criterion (HAMD total score <= 7) at week 12. Conclusions: In the present study, escitalopram improved quality of life and reduced depression in breast cancer patients. Symptoms rapidly improved within 1 week, influencing quality of life. Escitalopram may be an effective treatment of depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB  - This study explores the relationship between clinician-reported content addressed in sessions, measured with the Session Report Form (SRF), and multi-informant problem alerts stemming from a larger battery of treatment process and progress measures. Multilevel Multinomial Logit Models were conducted with 133 clinicians and 299 youths receiving home-based treatment (N = 3,143 sessions). Results indicate a strong relationship between session content and problems related to youth symptoms and functioning as reported by clinicians in the same session. Session content was related to emotional, family, and friend/peer problems reported by youth and youth behavioral problems reported by caregivers. High-risk problems (alcohol/substance use, harm to self or others) were strongly related to session content regardless of informant. Session content was not related to problem alerts associated with the treatment process, caregiver strain, or client/caregiver strengths.

AB  - Background: During the process of implantation, parents may have rather heterogeneous expectations and concerns about their child's development and the functioning of habilitation and education services. Their views on habilitation and education are important for building family-centred practices. Aims: We explored the perceptions of parents and speech and language therapists (SLTs) on the effects of implantation on the child and the family and on the quality of services provided. Their views were also compared. Methods & Procedures: Parents and SLTs of 18 children filled out questionnaires containing open-and closed-ended questions at 6 months and annually 1-5 years after activation of the implant. Their responses were analysed mainly using data-based inductive content analysis. Outcomes & Results: Positive experiences outnumbered negative ones in the responses of both the parents and the SLTs surveyed. The parents were particularly satisfied with the improvement in communication and expanded social life in the family. These were the most prevalent themes also raised by the SLTs. The parents were also satisfied with the organization and content of habilitation. Most of the negative experiences were related to arrangement of hospital visits and the usability and maintenance of speech processor technology. Some children did not receive enough speech and language therapy, and some of the parents were dissatisfied with educational services. The habilitation process had generally required parental efforts at an expected level. However, parents with a child with at least one concomitant problem experienced habilitation as more stressful than did other parents. Conclusions & Implications: Parents and SLTs had more positive than negative experiences with implantation. As the usability and maintenance of speech processor technology were often compromised, we urge implant centres to ensure sufficient personnel for technical maintenance. It is also important to promote services by providing enough information and parental support Background: During the process of implantation, parents may have rather heterogeneous expectations and concerns about their child's development and the functioning of habilitation and education services.

AB  - Background Psychological therapies have been developed for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. Such therapies include parent only or parent and child/adolescent, and are designed to treat parent behaviour, parent mental health, child behaviour/disability, child mental health, child symptoms and/or family functioning. No comprehensive, meta-analytic reviews have been published in this area. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies that include coping strategies for parents of children/adolescents with chronic illnesses (painful conditions, cancer, diabetes mellitus, asthma, traumatic brain injury, inflammatory bowel diseases, skin diseases or gynaecological disorders). The therapy will aim to improve parent behaviour, parent mental health, child behaviour/disability, child mental health, child symptoms and family functioning. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions that included parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. The initial search was from inception of these databases to June 2011 and we conducted a follow-up search from June 2011 to March 2012. We identified additional studies from the reference list of retrieved papers and from discussion with investigators. Selection criteria Included studies were RCTs of psychological interventions that delivered treatment to parents of children and adolescents (under 19 years of age) with a chronic illness compared to active control, wait list control or treatment as usual. We excluded studies if the parent component was a coaching intervention, the aim of the intervention was health prevention/promotion, the comparator was a pharmacological treatment, the child/adolescent had an illness not listed above or the study included children with more than one type of chronic illness. Further to this, we excluded studies when the sample size of either comparator group was fewer than 10 at post-treatment. Data collection and analysis We included 35 RCTs involving a total of 2723 primary trial participants. Two review authors extracted data from 26 studies. We analysed data using two categories. First, we analysed data by each medical condition across all treatment classes at two time points (immediately post-treatment and the first available follow-up). Second, we analysed data by each treatment class (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family therapy (FT), problem solving therapy (PST) and multisystemic therapy (MST)) across all medical conditions at two time points (immediately post-treatment and the first available follow-up). We assessed treatment effectiveness on six possible outcomes: parent behaviour, parent mental health, child behaviour/disability, child mental health, child symptoms and family functioning. Main results Across all treatment types, psychological therapies that included parents significantly improved child symptoms for painful conditions immediately post-treatment. Across all medical conditions, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) significantly improved child symptoms and problem solving therapy significantly improved parent behaviour and parent mental health immediately post-treatment. There were no other effects at post-treatment or follow-up. The risk of bias of included studies is described. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence on the effectiveness of psychological therapies that include parents in most outcome domains of functioning, for a large number of common chronic illnesses in children. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of including parents in psychological therapies that reduce pain in children with painful conditions. There is also good evidence for the effectiveness of CBT that includes parents for improving the primary symptom complaints when available data were included from chronic illness conditions. Finally, there is good evidence for the effectiveness of problem solving therapy delivered to parents on improving parent problem solving skills and parent mental health.

AB  - Purpose: Optimizing home and community participation of children with physical disabilities is an important outcome of rehabilitation. Method: A review of literature identified research and theory on participation of children with physical disabilities. The authors' incorporated current knowledge to conceptualize the experience of optimal participation, formulate principles of participation-based physical and occupational therapy, and develop a five-step process for intervention. A case report was completed to illustrate application to practice. Results: Optimal participation involves the dynamic interaction of determinants (attributes of the child, family, and environment) and dimensions (physical, social, and self engagement) of participation. Real-life experiences enable children to learn new activities and develop skills that optimize their participation and self-determination. Interventions are: goal-oriented, family-centered, collaborative, strengths-based, ecological, and self-determined. A distinguishing feature of intervention is that the therapist's primary role is to support the child and family to identify challenges to participation and solutions to challenges. The therapist is a consultant, collaborating with the child, family, and community providers to share information, educate, and instruct in ways that build child, family, and community capacity. Conclusion: The model may have utility for collaboration with families and community providers, determining goals for participation, and providing evidence-informed interventions Purpose: Optimizing home and community participation of children with physical disabilities is an important outcome of rehabilitation.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the extent and the nature of agreement on health-related quality of life (QOL) assessments between terminally ill cancer patients and their primary family caregivers in Japan, using a multidimensional QOL instrument including psychosocial and spiritual domains. Methods: The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual well-being questionnaire was used to assess patients' QOL. Study subjects were inpatients of a palliative care unit (PCU), outpatients who applied for admission to the PCU, and their primary family caregivers. Results: QOL ratings were obtained from 102 of 197 eligible patient-caregiver dyads. A moderate level of patient-family concordance on patients' overall QOL as well as families' underestimation of patients' QOL were observed. Families reported on observable domains of patients' QOL more reliably and assessed subjective aspects, such as psychospiritual concerns less accurately. Families tended to underrate the patients' social aspect of QOL, whereas most patients gave the highest rating on support from their families. The spiritual domain, particularly regarding faith, showed the least agreement. The size of the systematic bias between patient and family assessments on the patients' QOL was moderate (>0.50). Conclusions: Families' limited ability to assess psychosocial and spiritual aspects of patients' QOL may suggest the need for better approaches or measures to assess these aspects of a patient's life. The systematic bias was larger than in earlier studies. Further investigation is needed to identify factors affecting patient-family discord on QOL assessments to guide effective interventions to enhance patient-caregiver agreement.

AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that the family members of adolescents with mental diseases experience distress, anxiety and depression, as well as economic strain, all of which contribute to physical and psychological caregiver morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of intervention to improve the caregiving experience of the parents of mentally ill adolescents. The parents of 20 patients were assessed with the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI) and the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI), while patients' functioning and psychopathology were evaluated with the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale and the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL), respectively. Assessments were conducted over 9 months, comparing the experimental group receiving the intervention with a control group that received "standard'' care. While there were no significant differences in the patients' psychopathologies, the caregivers in the experimental group had better ECI and WAI scores. Intervention focusing on the parents seemed to improve the caregivers' understanding of the disease's impact on their lives irrespective of the severity of their children's condition.

AB  - Depression during adolescence represents a significant public health concern. It is estimated that up to 20% of adolescents experience an episode of depression that interferes with academic and social functioning and is associated with an increased risk for self harm. Although significant progress has been made in the last decade in treating mental health problems in young people, effective treatment of depression has been harder to demonstrate. In this paper, we describe the application of a promising evidence-based treatment for adult depression, behavioral activation (BA), to the treatment of depressed adolescents. We briefly present the history and overview of the standard BA approach to adult depression and discuss the rationale for the extension of this approach to adolescent depression. We then focus in detail on the process of adapting the treatment to be adolescent-specific by presenting an early client whom we treated without success. The paper closes with a discussion of lessons learned from our experience of treatment failure, including the need to (a) take a more nuanced view of rumination with a focus on shaping brooding into reflective problem. solving, (b) maintain a structured but flexible approach that allows for early introduction of treatment skills most relevant to the individual adolescent, (c) build in careful tracking of suicide risk, and (d) attend to family engagement.

AB  - Relative to the United States and other western countries, less research has focused on factors associated with caregiving burden and maternal pessimism in Taiwanese mothers of adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The characteristics of 50 adolescents with an ASD living at home in Taiwan and its association with caregiving burden and maternal pessimism were examined. The age range of adolescents with an ASD was from 10 to 18. Mothers, aged 35 to 55 years, completed self-report written questionnaires regarding their child's adaptive functioning and their own perceptions of caregiving burdens and concerns. Findings indicated that functional independence, severe maladaptive behaviours and severity of autism were predictive of maternal caregiving burden. Maternal pessimism was associated with functional independence and severity of autism. The findings of this study indicated that occupational therapy practitioners could focus on training functional independence of the individual with an ASD to meet the family's need in Taiwan. Researchers should pay significant attention to the lifespan issues of autism in Taiwanese families. The major limitations of this study were small sample size and without a comparison group. Future research using larger samples with a comparison group is needed.

AB  - Data from 1790 HIV-infected and uninfected men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) were analyzed to evaluate relationships between physical function, incident diabetes mellitus (DM) and insulin resistance among HIV-infected and -uninfected men. DM was defined in two ways, using less stringent and more stringent criteria. The 10-item Physical Functioning Scale from the Short Form-36 Health Survey measured baseline physical function. Cumulative DM incidence was highest among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected men with low physical function. Physical function was a risk factor for DM in HIV-uninfected men and remained so after controlling for BMI, DM family history and race. Among HIV-infected men, physical function was an independent risk factor for DM using the less stringent diabetes definition.

This study supports our previous findings that low physical function is an important risk factor for DM in the MACS cohort

AB  - We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study to explore the relationship of suicidal ideation, mental health problems, and social functioning to acne severity among adolescents aged 18-19 years. A total of 4,744 youth were invited and 3,775 (80%) participated. In all, 14% reported having substantial acne (a lot and very much). Among those with very much acne, as compared those with no/little acne, suicidal ideation was twice as frequently reported among girls (25.5 vs. 11.9%) and three times more frequently reported among boys (22.6 vs. 6.3%). Suicidal ideation remained significantly associated with substantial acne (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.30-2.50) in a multivariate model including adjustments of symptoms of depression, ethnicity, and family income. Mental health problems, as assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (2.25, 1.69-3.00), low attachment to friends (1.52, 1.21-1.91), not thriving at school (1.41, 1.12-1.78), never having had a romantic relationship (1.35, 1.05-1.70), and never having had sexual intercourse (1.51, 1.21-1.89) were all associated with substantial acne in a multivariate model. Acne is frequently found in late adolescence and is associated with social and psychological problems. Adverse events including suicidal ideation and depression that have been associated with therapies for acne may reflect the burden of substantial acne rather than the effects of medication We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study to explore the relationship of suicidal ideation, mental health problems, and social functioning to acne severity among adolescents aged 18-19 years.
