AB  - QUESTION: Does cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), functional family therapy (FFT), combined FFT and CBT, or a group psychoeducational intervention reduce adolescent substance abuse? Design Randomised (unclear allocation concealment*), unblinded*, controlled trial with 7 months of follow up Setting A university centre in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA Patients 120 adolescents who were 13-17 years of age (mean age 16 y, 80% boys), lived at home with a primary caretaker willing to participate in the study, and met DSM-IV criteria for a primary substance abuse disorder (primarily illicit drug use). Exclusion criteria were need for services beyond outpatient treatment, evidence of a psychotic or organic state, or a sibling in the study. Follow up was 88% at 4 months and 89% at 7 months Intervention Adolescents were allocated to 1 of 4 groups: FFT (n=30), individual CBT (n=31), combined FFT and CBT (n=29), or a group intervention (n=30). FFT consisted of 12 weekly sessions of a systems oriented, behaviouralty based family therapy with 2 phases: engaging families in treatment and enhancing motivation for change, and implementing behavioural changes in the family. Individual CBT consisted of motivational enhancement (2 sessions) and skills modules (10 sessions), including communication training, problem solving, peer refusal, and relapse prevention. The joint intervention consisted of weekly sessions of FFT and individual CBT The group intervention provided education about substance abuse and its treatment and prevention (eight 90 min sessions) Main outcome measure Proportion of youths achieving minimal use (ie, use on < 10% of the days reported using the Timeline follow back interview) Main results A 4 x 3 repeated measures analysis of variance was done. At 4 months after treatment, FFT; joint FFT and CBT, and CBT alone showed reductions in adolescent marijuana use. At 7 months after treatment, FFT alone, joint FIT and CBT, and the group intervention showed reductions in marijuana use. When die FFT and joint conditions were combined for analysis, more adolescents in the combined family conditions than in the group condition changed from heavy to minimal marijuana use at 4 months (p < 0.013) but the difference was not statistically significant at 7 months (p < 0.128) (table). Combined family therapy plus CBT was better than CBT alone for increasing minimal use in adolescents at 7 months (p < 0.028) but the difference was not statistically significant at 4 months (table) Conclusion In adolescents with substance abuse, family based therapy, particularly in combination with cognitive behavioural therapy, showed better treatment outcomes for adolescents at 7 months after treatment *See glossary QUESTION: Does cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), functional family therapy (FFT), combined FFT and CBT, or a group psychoeducational intervention reduce adolescent substance abuse?

AB  - There is a dearth of research examining treatment engagement and attendance among runaway youth and their families. Such research is needed in order to inform treatment providers on factors associated with engagement and maintenance of these difficult to engage families into counseling. This study examined differential treatment attendance for alcohol abusing runaway youth residing at a local shelter. A traditional office-based family systems approach, Functional Family Therapy (FFT), was compared to a non-traditional, home-based, multisystemic family therapy approach, Ecologically Based Family Therapy (EBFT). As expected, treatment engagement and attendance was significantly higher for those assigned to EBFT (N = 37) compared to FFT (N = 40). Predictors of treatment attendance (income, family chaos, externalization problems and level of youth substance use) were examined within each treatment modality. Findings suggest that home-based (compared to office-based) treatment modalities may significantly increase treatment attendance and engagement of runaway youth and their families. Non-traditional forms of treatment may need to be considered in order to best meet the needs of highly chaotic and disorganized family systems. Copyright <ef><bf><bd> 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam.

AB  - Adolescence is a unique time period in an individual's life, one in which suicide and substance abuse become substantial health risks. Currently, suicide accounts for approximately 14% of all deaths among 15-24 year olds in the U.S.A. Drug, alcohol abuse and dependence are the most prevalent causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality in the USA. Numerous studies have demonstrated the link between adolescent alcohol, substance abuse and suicide. When compared to community controls, the rate of a substance abuse disorder was 8.5 times higher in a sample of adolescent suicide completers and the rate of alcohol abuse was 7.5 times higher. Genetic and biological variables may also be responsible for either alcohol and substance abuse or suicide or both alcohol and substance abuse and suicide. There is little empirical research evaluating the effectiveness of alcohol and substance abuse treatments for adolescents. Therapies such as multisystemic therapy, functional family therapy, motivational interviewing, community reinforcement, the 12-step approach and contingency management reinforcement seem to be effective treatments. Despite the strong association between adolescent alcohol and substance use and suicidal behaviors, few studies have investigated the combined treatment of these two issues. Cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly dialectical behavior therapy, seems to be a promising psychotherapy treatment for suicidality in alcohol and substance abusing adolescents.

AB  - This study examined treatment outcomes of 86 highly acculturated Hispanic and Anglo substance-abusing adolescents in functional family therapy, testing the hypothesis that ethnic matching of therapist and client is related to better treatment outcomes for clients. Adolescents reported on their substance use pre- and posttreatment on a timeline follow-back interview. Ethnically matched Hispanic adolescents demonstrated greater decreases in their substance use compared with Hispanic adolescents with Anglo therapists. Ethnic match status was not related to treatment outcome for Anglo clients. Thus, the matching hypothesis was supported for Hispanic clients only. The results underscore the importance of greater ethnic diversity among therapists and better cultural competency training for Anglo therapists. More research is needed on individual differences in the effects of ethnic matching.

AB  - In this study, the authors examined the role of balance between adolescent-therapist and parent-therapist alliances in the retention of functional family therapy clients. Therapeutic alliances of mothers, fathers, and adolescents were assessed from videotapes of the 1st treatment session for 43 Hispanic and 43 Anglo families. Hispanic families who dropped out before completing the requisite number of sessions were found to have greater imbalance in alliance (parent-adolescent) than those who did complete therapy. However, this finding was not replicated with Anglo families.

AB  - This study is designed to examine in-session therapeutic processes that contribute to engagement and retention in family therapy with drug abusing adolescents. In particular, this study examines common therapist interventions and core family processes that predict failure to engage (i.e., family drop outs prior to sessions 4) and failure to retain (i.e., family drop outs after session 4-7) in treatment. It is hypothesize that for families that engage in therapy, therapist Support and Cognitive Restructuring interventions will lead to increased family Alliance and decreased Conflict/Negativity respectively. It is further hypothesized that for families that retain in therapy, therapist Directive interventions will lead to increases in family Parenting. Families will be selected from the archives of three established family therapy programs (Functional Family Therapy; Multidimensional Family Therapy; Structural; Family Therapy). Common therapist interventions and core family processes will be identified from codings (microsession) and ratings (macrosession) of videotaped sessions. Preliminary confirmatory factor analyses will be conduced to examine the factor, structure of the common therapist interventions and core family processes.

AB  - Functional Family Therapy (FFT) is a therapeutic intervention that aims to prevent and reduce delinquency by changing intra-family members' dynamics. Preliminary results of an FFT evaluation in New Jersey are presented. The research employs a matched comparison group design to compare FFT participants (N=40) in the Children at Risk Resources and Interventions - Youth Intensive Intervention Program (CARRI-YIIP), with a comparison group (N=40) that received traditional group and individual therapeutic interventions via Youth Case Management (YCM). Most FFT and comparison youth were court-ordered to participate and/or on probation. The relative success of the two interventions is measured by a Strengths and Needs Assessment which includes information on child's life domain functioning, children's and caregivers' strengths, and children's behavioral and emotional needs and risks. Recidivism of the experimental group is indicated by new delinquency or adult criminal charges. Finally, the results of a qualitative assessment of FFT intervention and program satisfaction survey among participants and their families are described ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - In order to compete in a financially sensitive health care system, family systems-based treatments must demonstrate effective clinical results as well as cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness research can demonstrate to health care insurers and policy makers which treatments are viable options for implementation. The present literature review identified eight cost-effectiveness family-based substance abuse treatment studies. The results suggest that certain family-based treatments are cost-effective and warrant consideration for inclusion in health care delivery systems.

Methods: This introductory paper gives a brief overview of the development of ST and its evidence-based interventions. ST focuses on the interactional context of symptoms. Results: For more than 40 years systemic therapists have developed and employed treatments for substance use disorders. Starting points were early structural-strategic approaches, the classic Milan approach, and solution-focused approaches. Today, several evidence-based systemic <<trademark therapies>> have been developed: multidimensional family therapy, multisystemic therapy, functional family therapy, and brief strategic family therapy. Conclusions: ST has developed a wide variety of treatment approaches for substance use disorders which are not yet sufficiently applied in Germany. 2010 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG Aim: Following the recent recognition of systemic therapy (ST) as an evidence-based approach in Germany, we now face the question of how to integrate ST into the treatment of substance use disorders.

AB  - (from the chapter) Adolescence is a unique time period in an individual's life, one in which suicide and substance abuse become substantial health risks. Currently, suicide accounts for approximately 14% of all deaths among 15- 24 year olds in the USA. Drug, alcohol abuse and dependence are the most prevalent causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality in the USA. Numerous studies have demonstrated the link between adolescent alcohol, substance abuse and suicide. When compared to community controls, the rate of a substance abuse disorder was 8.5 times higher in a sample of adolescent suicide completers and the rate of alcohol abuse was 7.5 times higher. Genetic and biological variables may also be responsible for either alcohol and substance abuse or suicide or both alcohol and substance abuse and suicide. There is little empirical research evaluating the effectiveness of alcohol and substance abuse treatments for adolescents. Therapies such as multisystemic therapy, functional family therapy, motivational interviewing, community reinforcement, the 12-step approach and contingency management reinforcement seem to be effective treatments. Despite the strong association between adolescent alcohol and substance use and suicidal behaviors, few studies have investigated the combined treatment of these two issues. Cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly dialectical behavior therapy, seems to be a promising psychotherapy treatment for suicidality in alcohol and substance abusing adolescents. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of various treatments of alcohol and substance abusing adolescents with suicidal behavior.

AB  - (from the jacket) "Family Therapy for Adolescent Drug Abuse" presents the latest in research and thought on treatment methods for adolescent drug abuse and its connection to family life. This valuable book provides mental health professionals, family therapists, and drug counselors with specific techniques for treating adolescent drug abusers through family therapy. Drawing on myriad cases from their clinical practices as well as from up-to-date research data, the contributors thoroughly explore how adolescent drug abuse is a result of complex underlying problems that often involve the family and how it is inextricably bound to the psychology of adolescence. The volume concludes with detailed descriptions and analyses of family therapy conducted with eight families of adolescent substance abusers, including verbatim transcripts of family therapy sessions with critiques by experienced family therapists. (from the preface) The family is the central focus in virtually all the chapters we have solicited for this collection. It reflects our orientation, which perceives substance-abusing behavior in the adolescent primarily as an aspect of the dysbalanced functioning of his or her family. This view has led us to explore the possibility of enabling the adolescent to overcome his or her substance abuse through family psychotherapy. Several of the chapters, therefore, report the findings of a research project we recently concluded on this matter. . . . Our working hypothesis primarily asserts that helping a family achieve improved functioning enables the adolescent to gain a more socially constructive orientation toward his life experiences--thereby overcoming the impulse to engage in substance abuse and related illicit behaviors. One additional focus of this volume is to give recognition to the importance of scientific research in providing a firm, realistic base to clinical knowledge and procedures in the field of adolescent drug abuse. We recognize that, thus far, the field does not have solid scientific grounding. Our presentations show, however, that much serious and significant work has been accomplished.

Methods: Our sample consisted of 187 adolescents who were arrested during or following participation in FFT treatment. Results: The number of sessions correlated with the number of days that elapsed after intake to the first post-intake arrest. Conclusions: In an urban minority sample with many risk factors, clinicians need to be especially sensitive to adolescent cannabis use, other substance use, and association with deviant peers, adherence, and the Engagement/Motivation phase of FFT therapy.

The abuse and neglect experienced by these youth on the streets is compounded by societal neglect in addressing the needs of a population sorely requiring intervention. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. Given the void of treatment outcome research with these youths, and the high level of risk for health and psychological problems, there is a great need for identifying potent interventions. Although research supports the effectiveness of behavioral family therapy in reducing substance abuse among adolescents, no study has systematically applied and evaluated a family-based intervention with runaways.

AB  - Four 14- to 16-year-old white and Hispanic males and females participated in 5 to 12 months of behavioral family therapy. After a typical decrease in substance use and academic problems at the end of treatment, the problems of the first subject who received no booster sessions recurred and subsequently worsened during the 8 to 18 months of followup. The other three adolescents, who responded similarly to behavioral family therapy, participated in 6 months of booster sessions which led to a second decrease in substance use and academic problems. This improvement was maintained throughout followup. The study results were consistent across differing adolescent ages, genders, ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses, frequencies of substance use, times of year, and lengths of treatment. These findings suggest that recurrences of problem behaviors following treatment termination could be due to extinction and that booster sessions provide intermittent reinforcement of treatment effects. 2 figures and 21 references Four 14- to 16-year-old white and Hispanic males and females participated in 5 to 12 months of behavioral family therapy.

AB  - Random assignment was made of 182 clinically referred marijuana- and alcohol-abusing adolescents to one of three treatments: multidimensional family therapy (MDFT), adolescent group therapy (AGT), and multifamily educational intervention (MEI). Each treatment represented a different theory base and treatment format. All treatments were based on a manual and were delivered on a once-a-week outpatient basis. The therapists were experienced community clinicians trained to model-specific competence prior to the study and then supervised throughout the clinical trial. A theory-based multimodal assessment strategy measured symptom changes and prosocial functioning at intake, termination, and 6 and 12 months following termination. Results indicate improvement among youths in all three treatments, with MDFT showing superior improvement overall. MDFT participants also demonstrated change at the 1-year follow-up period in the important prosocial factors of school/academic performance and family functioning as measured by behavioral ratings. Results support the efficacy of MDFT, a relatively short-term, multicomponent, multitarget, family-based intervention in significantly reducing adolescent drug abuse and facilitating adaptive and protective developmental processes.

AB  - Aim To examine the efficacy of two adolescent drug abuse treatments: individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and multidimensional family therapy (MDFT). Design A 2 (treatment condition) x 4 (time) repeated-measures intent-to-treat randomized design. Data were gathered at baseline, termination, 6 and 12 months post-termination. Analyses used latent growth curve modeling. Setting Community-based drug abuse clinic in the northeastern United States. Participants A total of 224 youth, primarily male (81%), African American (72%), from low-income single-parent homes (58%) with an average age of 15 years were recruited into the study. All youth were drug users, with 75% meeting DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence and 13% meeting criteria for abuse. Measurements Five outcomes were measured: (i) substance use problem severity; (ii) 30-day frequency of cannabis use; (iii) 30-day frequency of alcohol use; (iv) 30-day frequency of other drug use; and (v) 30-day abstinence. Findings Both treatments produced significant decreases in cannabis consumption and slightly significant reductions in alcohol use, but there were no treatment differences in reducing frequency of cannabis and alcohol use. Significant treatment effects were found favoring MDFT on substance use problem severity, other drug use and minimal use (zero or one occasion of use) of all substances, and these effects continued to 12 months following treatment termination. Conclusion Both interventions are promising treatments. Consistent with previous controlled trials, MDFT is distinguished by the sustainability of treatment effects.

AB  - The initial onset of bipolar disorder occurs in childhood or adolescence in about 50% of patients. Early-onset forms of the disorder have a poorer prognosis than adult-onset forms and are frequently characterized by comorbid substance abuse. Clinical trials research suggests that family psychoeducational approaches are effective adjuncts to medication in stabilizing the symptoms of bipolar disorder in adults and youth, although their efficacy in patients with comorbid substance use disorders has not been systematically investigated. This article describes the family-focused treatment (FFT) of a late adolescent with bipolar disorder and polysubstance dependence. The treatment of this patient and family required adapting FFT to consider the family's structure, dysfunctional alliance patterns, and unresolved conflicts from early in the family's history. The case illustrates the importance of conducting manual-based behavioral family treatments with a psychotherapeutic attitude, including addressing unstated emotional conflicts and resistances that may impede progress. 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc The initial onset of bipolar disorder occurs in childhood or adolescence in about 50% of patients. Early-onset forms of the disorder have a poorer prognosis than adult-onset forms and are frequently characterized by comorbid substance abuse. Clinical trials research suggests that family psychoeducational approaches are effective adjuncts to medication in stabilizing the symptoms of bipolar disorder in adults and youth, although their efficacy in patients with comorbid substance use disorders has not been systematically investigated. This article describes the family-focused treatment (FFT) of a late adolescent with bipolar disorder and polysubstance dependence. The treatment of this patient and family required adapting FFT to consider the family's structure, dysfunctional alliance patterns, and unresolved conflicts from early in the family's history. The case illustrates the importance of conducting manual-based behavioral family treatments with a psychotherapeutic attitude, including addressing unstated emotional conflicts and resistances that may impede progress. 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc

AB  - Program comparison is needed to evaluate the effectiveness that each program has on similar populations. This study comparatively evaluated an evidence based program and a theory based program designed for intervention with high risk children. The evidence based program used in this study was functional family therapy, and the theory based program was intensive in-home. The comparison of programs was based on archival data assessing parental perception of change in symptomology. Forty-seven parents completed pre and post Youth Outcome Questionnaires for the functional family therapy program and 48 parents completed pre and post Youth Outcome Questionnaires for the intensive in-home program. ANOVA and t-test analyses were used that resulted in significant differences for each program's individual effectiveness. However, when compared, neither program was shown more effective over the other. This study highlights the necessity for program evaluation, particularly in terms of evaluating multiple treatment approaches for specific populations.

AB  - Prolonged waiting times to receive mental health services are common and may have negative consequences. This study examines the relationship between waiting time and treatment engagement among 2,054 youth referred to an evidence based treatment (EBT). Findings indicate that families are more likely to refuse services if they face longer waiting times. Families exposed to a prolonged waiting time were also more likely to drop out prematurely from Functional Family Therapy, but this relationship was not significant among youth receiving Multisystemic Therapy. Implications for EBT implementation and strategies for engaging families are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the degree of disagreement between runaway adolescents and their primary caretakers, defined as informant discrepancies, on their view of their family. How these discrepancies changed over time and whether family therapy or individual therapy could impact that change were also explored. The current sample (N=179 dyads) included adolescent substance abusers residing in a runaway shelter and their primary caretakers. Adolescent gender was examined as a correlate of change, and treatment attendance was controlled. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure discrepancies between the individuals within a dyad. Results showed that among those receiving family therapy, but not individual therapy, informant discrepancies decreased significantly over time. Additionally, dyads with a male adolescent showed a significantly slower rate of improvement in discrepancy scores across time compared with dyads with a female adolescent. Previous research indicates that lower levels of discrepant perceptions are associated with better individual and relationship functioning. Therefore, this study's findings support family therapy as superior to individual therapy for addressing parentchild discrepanciespossibly through its focus on improving family communication, perspective taking, and understanding This study examined the degree of disagreement between runaway adolescents and their primary caretakers, defined as informant discrepancies, on their view of their family.

AB  - Purpose: Prompted by calls to implement evidence-based practices (EBPs) into residential care settings (RCS), this review addresses three questions: (1) Which EBPs have been tested with children and youth within the context of RCS? (2) What is the evidence for their effectiveness within such settings? (3) What implementation issues arise when transporting EBPs into RCS? Methods: Evidence-based psychosocial interventions and respective outcome studies, published from 1990 to 2012, were identified through a multi-phase search process, involving the review of four major clearinghouse websites and relevant electronic databases. To be included, effectiveness had to have been previously established through a comparison group design regardless of the setting, and interventions tested subsequently with youth in RCS. All outcome studies were evaluated for quality and bias using a structured appraisal tool. Results: Ten interventions matching a priori criteria were identified: Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, Aggression Replacement Training, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Ecologically-Based Family Therapy, Eye Movement and Desensitization Therapy, Functional Family Therapy, Multimodal Substance Abuse Prevention, Residential Student Assistance Program, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, and Trauma Intervention Program for Adjudicated and At-Risk Youth. Interventions were tested in 13 studies, which were conducted in different types of RCS, using a variety of study methods. Outcomes were generally positive, establishing the relative effectiveness of the interventions with youth in RCS across a range of psychosocial outcomes. However, concerns about methodological bias and confounding factors remain. Most studies addressed implementation issues, reporting on treatment adaptations, training and supervision, treatment fidelity and implementation barriers. Conclusion: The review unearthed a small but important body of knowledge that demonstrates that EBPs can be implemented in RCS with encouraging results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the system-level effects of implementing a promising treatment for adolescent substance abuse in juvenile drug courts (JDCs). Six JDCs were randomized to receive training in the experimental intervention (contingency management-family engagement [CM-FAM)] or to continue their usual services (US). Participants were 104 families served by the courts, 5 I therapists, and 74 JDC stakeholders (e.g., judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys). Assessments included repeated measurements of CM-FAM implementation by therapists and therapist and stakeholder perceptions of incentive-based interventions and organizational characteristics. Results revealed greater use of CM and family engagement techniques among CM-FAM relative to US therapists. In addition, therapists and stakeholders in the CM-FAM condition reported more favorable attitudes toward the use of incentives and greater improvement on several domains of organizational functioning relative to US counterparts. Taken together, these findings suggest that JDC professionals are amenable to the adoption and implementation of a treatment model that holds promise for improving youth outcomes.
