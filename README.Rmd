Small example of how to ask a question in ChatGPT
```{r}
# Find your api key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys 
# Thereafter, either encrypt it with the secret functions from the httr2 package
# see https://httr2.r-lib.org/reference/secrets.html or run set_api_key() 
# and then enter you key.
library(AIscreenR)
library(httr2)

set_api_key(AIscreenR:::testing_key_chatgpt())

q <- "What is a carrot?"
ask_chatgpt(q, time_info = TRUE)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Find documentation behind by running the below code
?AIscreenR::ask_chatgpt
