This vignette represent tentative work-in-progress only. The general applicability and efficacy of using large-language models (LLMs) including ChatGPT for title and abstract screening in literature reviews are still unknown. Our first results suggest that ChatGPT can be a reliable second screener when reviewing specific and well defined interventions. The first evidence of this is shown in this vignette. However, be aware that our first results are based on a retrospective analysis which might not generalize to prospective screenings where ChatGPT potentially has not been trained on that reference data, that is data added to the internet after 2021. We have started testing the AIscreenR on more complex reviews. Here it seems to be harder to make concise prompts that can make ChatGPT emulating a reliable human second screener. Yet, the first tentative evidence for complex reviews suggests that ChatGPT can function well to reduce the total number of references that has to be screened by humans.

## Getting API key OpenAI

Before you can use the function from `AIscreenR`, you must generate your own secret
API key. To do so you must first ensure that you have created an account at OpenAI (*if you have not done so at this stage, you can sign up [here](https://auth0.openai.com/u/login/identifier?state=hKFo2SBqQjNHSlc1ejIyREpUb01hdDF2OHEzQy12NnJwWlFUN6Fur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIEJSOWJaamdKLWswNGlfWDQ2NER1OXJmVUNpVmVzVjZfo2NpZNkgRFJpdnNubTJNdTQyVDNLT3BxZHR3QjNOWXZpSFl6d0Q)).* When having an account, go to [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and press the `+ Create new secret key` button (see picture below) and give your key a name. 

\  

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("helper-stuff/API_key_pic.png")
```
\ 

When you have generate your secret API key, remember to store it safely since
you will not be able see it again. **NOTE**: *If you lose your API key, you can 
just generate a new one*. 

## Handling your API key with `AIscreenR`

### Temporary solution

### Pemanent solution

To add your API key permanently as an environment variables, you can execute
`usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

\  

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("helper-stuff/Renviron.png")
```
\ 

After entering the API key, save the `.Renviron` document and restart `RStudio` (ctrl + shift + F10).

## Retrieve rate limit information 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Rate limits across one model (Default is "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613")
rate_limits <- rate_limits_per_minute()
rate_limits
#> # A tibble: 1 × 3
#>   model              requests_per_minute tokens_per_minute
#>   <chr>                            <dbl>             <dbl>
#> 1 gpt-3.5-turbo-0613                3500             90000


# Rate limits overview across multiple models
models <- c("gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "gpt-4")
models_rate_limits <- rate_limits_per_minute(model = models) # Add further models if necessary
models_rate_limits
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>   model              requests_per_minute tokens_per_minute
#>   <chr>                            <dbl>             <dbl>
#> 1 gpt-3.5-turbo-0613                3500             90000
#> 2 gpt-4                              200             10000
```

## Approximate price of screening

Example of how to enter a prompt. Can also be done in word.

```{r}
prompt <- "Evaluate the following study based on the selection criteria
for a systematic review on the effects of family-based interventions on drug 
abuse reduction for young people in treatment for non-opioid drug use.
A family-based intervention (FFT) is equivalent to a behavior focused
family therapy, where young people’s drug use is understood in relation to 
family behavior problems. Family-based interventions also includes manual-based 
family therapies as it targets young people and their families as a system 
throughout treatment, and thereby recognizes the important role of the family 
system in the development and treatment of young people’s drug use problems. 
FFT was developed in the late 1980s on request from the US National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA). The development of FFT was initially heavily inspired by the 
alcohol abuse program Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), which was aimed 
at restructuring the environment to reinforce non-alcohol associated activities. 
FFT developed to have more emphasis on contingency contracting, impulse control 
strategies specific to drug use, and increased emphasis on involvement of family 
members in treatment. FFT is designed to accommodate diverse populations of 
youths with a variety of behavioral, cultural and individual preferences. 
FFT has evolved for use in severe behavioral disturbances known to co-exist with
substance use and dependence, and the core interventions have been enhanced to 
address several mental health related problems commonly occurring
as comorbid conditions in drug use treatment participant.  For each study,
I would like you to assess:  1) Is the study about a family-based intervention,
such as Functional Family Therapy, Multidimensional Family Therapy, or
Behavioral Family Therapy? (Outpatient manual-based interventions of any
duration delivered to young people and their families). If not, exclude study.
2) Are the participants in outpatient drug treatment primarily
for non-opioid drug use? 3) Are the participants within age 11–21?"
