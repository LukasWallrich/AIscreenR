AB  - Introduction: Working memory (WM) plays a central role in cognitive functions, and learning and its capacity predicts and determines other cognitive and academic functions. One of the most famed working memory theories is the Allan Baddeley’s multicomponent model with four components. In this model, there are two slave systems that save information without manipulating them and two clever systems that can process and save information simultaneously. The positive point in Baddeley’s model is accessible parts for working memory that can study more easily in experimental investigations. However, there is no specific scale that includes all four components of the multicomponent theory of Baddeley in children. Therefore, this study aims to create a 4-components scale of working memory in children (WM-4CSC). Methods: This study was experimental and developmental research. First of all, based on the theoretical background, all assessment tools of working memory were gathered (all computerized and paper-basedtools). Then, they were established on experts’ opinions and their agreements (CVR and CVI scale), two tasks for each component were selected and translated and coincided with the Persian language and matched to the age of the samples. For the present study, 80 typical children (50 female, 30 male) and ten children with WM deficits in 4-6 grades (8-12 years) with normal IQ participated. All the students were selected from non-profit schools in 1-3 regions in Tehran, Iran. The subjects were divided into three groups: 4th grade, 5th grade, and 6th grade. For all participants, the examiner explained each task, and when they got the instruction, the test was conducted. Data were analyzed using the One-Way ANOVA and Pearson Correlation Test in SPSS-26. Results: Results showed significant differences in all scale tasks between three school grades and between typical and atypical children. Nevertheless, there were no differences between the two genders. There was a high correlation between test-retest scores and convergent and diagnostic validities. Cronbach’s alpha was acceptable in all tasks. Moreover, a medium correlation was found in concurrent criterion validity. Conclusion: with respect to results, it was indicated that a 4-components Scale of working memory has reasonable developmental, retest, diagnostic, and convergent validities and good reliability. Therefore, based on the appropriate validity and reliability of this scale, it can be used by other researchers and more studies. For the future, it is suggested to use this scale in more studies with a more excellent sample to normalize it. Also, it can use in more different ages in children. Moreover, it is suggested to use this scale in different types of developmental disorders and detemine the strengths and weaknesses of each disorder in children.

AB  - The negative thoughts that anxious children experience while sitting for an exam consume working memory resources at the cost of resources for performing on the exam. In a randomized field experiment (N = 117) with primary school students, we investigated the hypothesis that stimulating students to look through the problems of a math test before they start solving them would reduce anxiety, release these anxiety‐related working memory resources, and lead to higher test performance than not allowing students to look ahead in the test. The results confirmed the hypothesis, indicating that the positive effects of looking ahead applied to all students, regardless of their anxiety level (low, medium, or high). The results suggest that by looking ahead in a test, less working memory resources are consumed by intrusive thoughts, and consequently, more resources can be used for performing on the test. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - If a child asks a friend to play football and the friend replies, 'I have a cough', the requesting child must make a 'relevance inference' to determine the communicative intent. Relevance inferencing is a key component of pragmatics, that is, the ability to integrate social context into language interpretation and use. We tested which cognitive skills relate to relevance inferencing. In addition, we asked whether children's lab-based pragmatic performance relates to children's parent-assessed pragmatic language skills. We tested 3.5- to 4-year-old speakers of British English (Study 1: N = 40, Study 2: N = 32). Children were presented with video-recorded vignettes ending with an utterance requiring a relevance inference, for which children made a forced choice. Study 1 measured children's Theory of Mind, their sentence comprehension and their real-world knowledge and found that only real-world knowledge retained significance in a regression analysis with children's relevance inferencing as the outcome variable. Study 2 then manipulated children's world-knowledge through priming but found this did not improve children's performance on the relevance inferencing task. Study 2 did, however, reveal a significant correlation between children's relevance inferencing and a measure of morpho-syntactic production. In both studies parents rated their children's pragmatic language usage in daily life, which was found to relate to performance in our lab-based relevance inferencing task. This set of studies is the first to empirically demonstrate that lab-based measures of relevance inferencing are reflective of children's pragmatic abilities 'in the wild'. There was no clear association between relevance inferencing and Theory of Mind. There was mixed evidence for the role of formal language, which should be further investigated. Finally, real-world knowledge was indeed associated with relevance inferencing but future experimental work is required to test causal relations.

AB  - This study was intended to evaluate the impact of socioeconomically disadvantaged children’s participation in the Texas home instruction for parents of preschool youngsters (TXHIPPY) program on their school readiness and academic achievement for grades K to eight. The study used a quasi-experimental design and applied optimal full propensity score matching (PSM) to address the evaluation concern of the impact of the TXHIPPY program on HIPPY participants’ academic achievement compared to non-HIPPY participants. This study targeted former HIPPY participants and tracked them in the Dallas independent school district (DISD) database through grade levels. Data were obtained by administering istation’s indicators of progress (ISIP) for kindergarten, TerraNova/SUPERA for grades K to two, and State of Texas assessments of academic readiness (STAAR) for math and reading for grades three to eight. HIPPY and non-HIPPY groups were matched using propensity score analysis procedures. The findings show that the TXHIPPY program positively influences kindergarten students to start school ready to learn. The findings of math and reading achievements suggest that HIPPY children scored at the same level or higher than non-HIPPY children did on math and reading achievement, indicating that TXHIPPY program has achieved its goal of helping children maintain long-term academic success. However, the study findings also indicate that the impact evaluation framework must be designed with attention to higher-level factors beyond academic achievement that influence children’s academic success. This work is vital to policymakers, program managers, and evaluators in the field of home visiting interventions in which it guides implementing rigorous evaluation studies.

AB  - In January of 2002, President Brush signed the 'No Child Left Behind Act' (NCLB) into law (NCLB, 2002). This law has changed public education and affected how teachers instruct. Teachers may now teach more for coverage than understanding of concepts in order to prepare students for the state achievement tests. Students need to become scientifically literate in order to make informed decisions based on factual evidence. Being able to make informed decisions requires an understanding and ability to apply a wide range of scientific knowledge and skills, as well as the ability to use language clearly and concisely to comprehend and articulate science ideas and issues. The purpose of this study was to compare how two methods of structuring science notebooks and classroom science activities affect student achievement as measured by reading, mathematics, language, science content, science process skills, cognitive development, and changes in the understanding specific concepts throughout the semester formative assessments. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed on data collected from two groups of seventh grade students taking life science during the spring semester of 2008. Each group was taught using either a more teacher-centered and teacher-structured notebook or a more student-centered, inquiry-based approach. An Analysis of Covariance was used for most of the comparisons between the two treatment groups. Using a more teacher-centered and teacher-structured notebooks represents a more traditional method for coverage of concepts, while using a more student-centered, inquiry-based approach represents teaching for understanding. According to the results of this study, there were no statistical differences in student achievement as measured by reading, mathematics, language usage, and science state standardized test scores, science process skills (total integrated process skills, TIPS II), cognitive development (group assessment of logical thinking, GALT), conceptual understanding (based on formative assessments of specific concepts for each unit of study), and life science content (end of course exam) between the two treatment groups. There were some statistical differences between the pre- and posttest achievement scores when the data was analyzed using a paired t-test to determine if instruction, regardless of treatment, affected student achievement. Statistical differences were found between pre- and posttest scores for reading and mathematics state achievement scores (effect size of 0.62 and 0.59, respectively), cognitive development (effect size = 0.40), conceptual understanding of controlled experiments (effect size = 1.04), conceptual understanding of plant characteristics (effect size = 0.55), and life science content knowledge (effect size = 2.7).

AB  - Children can successfully compare continuous proportions as early as 4 years of age, yet they struggle to compare discrete proportions at least to 10 years of age, especially when the discrete information is misleading. This study examined whether inhibitory control contributes to individual differences in discrete proportional reasoning and whether reasoning could be enhanced by priming continuous information. A total of 49 second-graders completed two tasks. In the Hearts and Flowers (H&F) task, a measure of inhibition, children pressed on either the corresponding or opposite side, depending on the identity of the displayed figure. In the Spinners task, a measure of proportional reasoning, children chose the spinner with the proportionally larger red area across continuous and two discrete formats. In the discrete adjacent format, the continuous stimuli were segmented into sections, which could be compatible with the proportional information or misleading; the discrete mixed format interspersed the colored sections from the discrete adjacent conditions. Finally, two priming groups were formed. Children who saw the continuous format immediately before the discrete adjacent format formed the continuous priming group (n = 26). Children who saw the discrete mixed format immediately before the discrete adjacent format formed the discrete priming group (n = 23). Our results showed that children who performed better on the H&F task also had better performance on the discrete counting misleading trials. Furthermore, children in the continuous priming group outperformed children in the discrete priming group, specifically in contexts where discrete information was misleading. These results suggest that children’s proportional reasoning may be improved by fostering continuous representations of discrete stimuli and by enhancing inhibitory control skills.

AB  - The present study examined the effect of consanguineous marriage in the Arab community on reading disabilities of offspring. It examined whether the rate of reading disabilities was higher among offspring of first-cousin parents than offspring of unrelated parents; and whether reading-disabled children of first-cousin parents were more disabled in phonological awareness and phonological decoding than reading-disabled children of unrelated parents and normally reading younger children. These questions were investigated among 814 pupils of the 4th, 5th, and 6th grades, using word recognition and reading comprehension tests. Two experimental groups were chosen from this population. These were a reading-disabled group of 22 pupils who were children of firstcousin marriages and 21 pupils who were children of unrelated parents. A control group was also selected, consisting of 21 younger normally reading pupils at the same reading level. All the groups were tested on non-words, real words, phonological, orthographic and working memory measures. The results indicated that the rate of reading disabilities among children of first-cousin parents was higher than that of with children of second-cousin parents, distantly related parents, or unrelated parents. Further, no differences were found in phonological awareness and decoding between the two reading-disabled groups. Moreover, the results indicate a significant advantage of the younger normal readers over the reading-disabled children in the measures of phonological awareness, decoding, and orthographical knowledge that requires spelling. However, in reading common words and choosing words in context, the performance of the reading-disabled groups and the normally reading group were similar. It has been suggested that further research is needed to evaluate the role of intelligence, nevertheless our results provide new evidence for a genetic basis to reading disabilities.

AB  - In neurotypical infants, genetically-specified attachment/attention mechanisms underpin the motivation to interact, which enables the acquisition of socio-cultural norms for language and accounts for the efficacy of socialization processes (Lee et al., 2009; Schumann, 2013). In children with autism, as in second language acquisition, neurodevelopmental differences in attachment/attention mechanisms may result in a diminished drive to interact, thus hindering the acquisition of socio-cultural norms for language and limiting the efficacy of language socialization (Lee et al., 2009; Schumann, 2013). This dissertation applies this theory of an 'interactional instinct' (Lee et al., 2009), beginning with a review of its relevance in societies that predominately practice polyadic and often subdued infant-caregiver interactions when compared to dyadic, face-to-face interactions that are typical in Western societies. It offers evidence that the uniformity of primary language acquisition can be explained because the language socialization that infants experience is commensurate with what they need in order to become competent language users in their communities. Three qualitative studies then follow. In the first study, infant language acquisition is analyzed in terms of a clean-up routine at a daycare. A close examination of non-vocal and vocal exchanges between a teacher and a neurotypical 14 month old demonstrates how affiliative cues may help to sustain the infant's on-going opportunities for language learning. In the second study, the efficacy of a language intervention for minimally-verbal older children with autism is presented. How conversational and discursive structures relate to desired therapeutic outcomes are described, especially in terms of eliciting and increasing boys' participation in play routines with therapists. In the third study, the experiences of parents and their children with autism who attend a basic-skills training program in India are examined. The core components of the training link to neurobiological accounts of language acquisition, and participants' experiences in these areas suggest instructional strategies for those providing support to individuals with autism, even in under-resourced areas, as well as second language teachers for older individuals. The review and the three studies address the topic of language access, or opportunities to participate in community activities, that language learning requires. In particular, they describe how affiliation in everyday interactions between teachers/therapists and learners promotes language access, regardless of age or ability.

AB  - This study investigated effective strategies for improving working memory and processing speed of students identified with dyslexia in Nigeria. The study adopted a quasi-experimental research design with the population made up of twenty four thousand seven hundred and twenty seven (24,727) senior secondary school students (S.S.2) in all the public secondary schools in Port Harcourt Rivers State Nigeria. The study adopted a purposive sampling method and three public schools were selected from the secondary schools in Phalga and Obio/Akpo LGA of Rivers State. The result proved that there is reasonable number of students suffering from dyslexia in Nigeria, and there is little or no attention given to the students living with dyslexia. Also, there is unchallengeable evidence that some students in Nigeria like other students in various parts of the world have dyslexia. The paper concludes by nothing that a child that has dyslexia may not outgrow it. But there are supports, teaching approaches, and strategies to help the child overcome the challenges.

AB  - The role of psycho-educational interventions in facilitating adaptation to chronic disease has received growing recognition and is in keeping with policy developments advocating greater involvement of patients in their own care. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the current literature regarding the effectiveness of psycho-educational interventions for children and adolescents with chronic disease, their parents and siblings. Electronic searches were conducted using AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Database, DARE, HTA, MEDLINE, NHS EED, PsycLIT, PsyclNFO, and PubMED. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews, metaanalyses and overviews based on traditional reviews of published literature. The titles of papers were reviewed, abstracts were obtained and reviewed, and full copies of selected papers were obtained. No reviews of psycho-educational interventions were found for either parents or siblings. Twelve reviews of interventions for children and adolescents were identified: chronic disease in general (three); chronic pain (one); asthma (three); chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) (one); diabetes (two); juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (one) and one informational intervention for paediatric cancer patients. The main focus was on disease management (particularly in asthma and diabetes) with less attention being paid to psychosocial aspects of life with a chronic condition. Overall, there is evidence of effectiveness for interventions incorporating cognitive-behavioural techniques on variables such as self-efficacy, self-management of disease, family functioning, psychosocial well-being, reduced isolation, social competence, knowledge, hope, pain (for chronic headache), lung function (asthma), days absent from school (asthma), visits to A & E (asthma), fatigue (CFS), and metabolic control (diabetes). A number of gaps and limitations were identified across all disease categories, such as inadequate description of interventions, small sample sizes, and lack of evidence regarding cost-effectiveness. This overview has highlighted the need to extend the evidence base for psychoeducational interventions, particularly in a UK context. It is essential that effective interventions are implemented and embedded in service provision in order to maximize empowerment through selfcare for children, adolescents and their parents.

AB  - This study investigated whether the amount and timing of group-based childcare between birth and 51 months were predictive of cognitive development at 51 months, taking into account other non-parental childcare, demographic characteristics, cognitive development at 18 months, sensitive parenting and a stimulating home environment. Children's (N=978) cognitive development was assessed at 51 months with four subscales of the British Ability Scales: two verbal and two non-verbal. Mothers were interviewed and observed at 3, 10, 18, and 36 months and the quality of group care was assessed at 10, 18, and 36 months (N=239) if it was used for >= 12 hours per week. Age of starting in group care and amount were highly associated (r = -.75). Multiple regressions indicated that, controlling for other factors, higher cognitive development and particularly non-verbal ability was associated with more hours per week in group care from 0 to 51 months, or an earlier start, or group care before age 2. Nevertheless, the majority of variance was explained by other predictors: sex (girl), higher cognitive development at 18 months, older mother, first language English, mother of white ethnic background, with more qualifications, higher family social class, more maternal responsivity at 10 months and a more stimulating home learning environment (HLE) at 36 months. Hours per week in relative care or home-based care were not significant predictors of cognitive scores. For the smaller relatively advantaged sample who had group care quality information (N=239), quality was a marginal predictor of better cognitive development but age of starting group care was not. Most variance was explained by 18 month cognitive development, maternal education, and family social class.

AB  - Research shows a considerable overlap between a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional dysfunctions and serious delinquency. This overlap is generally nonspecific and apparently reflects a high degree of functional impairment in delinquents rather than any particular type of dysfunction. Some data indicate specific links between altered functional arousal states and delinquency. These require further definition and analysis, especially regarding the relationships between attention deficits and conduct disorders. Primary prevention of juvenile delinquency involves the early diagnosis and effective treatment of conditions in children and families which predispose the children to later delinquency. The biomedical problems most responsive to available preventive and treatment measures are perinatal problems, learning problems, attention-deficit disorder, and parental problems. More research is needed on the nature, prevalence, and treatability of psychopathology in serious delinquents, and the association between specific learning disabilities and delinquency should be researched with more specificity. Parents and professionals should receive additional education about attention-deficit disorder, and agencies dealing with delinquents should make increased use of competent psychiatric consultation. Demonstration projects that provide comprehensive health care service for students through the public schools should also be explored. 2 notes and 155 references.

AB  - Introduction: Homeless and precariously housed young people are a complex, vulnerable population frequently perceived as being difficult to engage in health and social services. Although unrecognized deficits in cognitive functioning may adversely affect their ability to access assistance and meaningfully participate in programming, few researchers have examined these deficits. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of global and domain-specific cognitive impairment of street involved young people. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted using intake data from 494 clients (64% male; average age of 21 years) enrolled in a community-based inner city mental health program in Vancouver, Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to examine performance on six cognitive domains for a subsample (N = 44) referred for neuropsychological evaluation and bivariate statistics were used to compare youth who were and were not referred. Results: Cognitive impairment was evident in 80% of referred clients, with the most frequent difficulties involving attention and processing speed. Approximately 51% of clients referred for testing did not have more than a grade ten education and only 5% received government support for those with significant disabilities. Apart from alcohol use disorder, no significant differences were identified on sociodemographic and mental health variables between groups of referred and non-referred clients. Conclusions: Significant cognitive impairment was found in 80% of the young people referred for neuropsychological evaluation. This level of impairment combined with high levels of early school exiting and low levels of government support highlight the need for targeted screening to facilitate early identification and intervention.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the linear relationship and predictability between selected demographic and metacognitive variables and eighth-grade students' academic performance on the reading section of the state of Texas' TAKS (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills) assessment. The study was two-fold. First, the study examined whether the demographic variables of gender, ethnicity, and students' educational program had a linear relationship to middle school students' academic performance on the TAKS assessment. Second, the study examined whether three metacognitive reading strategies: global, support, and problem solving had linear relationships to middle school students' academic performance on the TAKS assessment. The instrument used to measure metacognitive strategies was the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI). The survey was developed by Mokhatari and Reichard (2002) and was administered to eighth-grade classes. The 2006 TAKS Reading scores were also utilized in this study. A demographic questionnaire was developed to ascertain specific information regarding student's gender, ethnicity, and educational programs. The results of the study revealed that the MARSI: Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory and selected student demographics had a significant relationship in only Reading Objectives 1, 3, and 4 of the TAKS Reading assessment. In contrast, the MARSI, and selected student demographics did not have a significant relationship to Reading Objective 2 on the TAKS Reading assessment. Data collected can be used to focus teachers and administrators on the tasks of integrating reading comprehension skills in all content areas and to provide intensive reading interventions to close the academic gap among ethnicities and genders in the classroom. To extend the scope of this investigation, the researcher recommends that follow-up studies be conducted to investigate the relationship of student demographics, metacognitive strategies, and other TAKS tests such as social studies, science, and mathematics. Furthermore, research efforts should be conducted in the area of grade point average (GPA) and educational status (at-risk) in correlation to TAKS tests results. Additionally, the researcher suggests that the relationship between teachers' metacognitive reading strategies and students' metacognitive reading strategies, as a predictor to academic achievement should be explored. Finally, a longitudinal study should be conducted on the relationship of middle school students' academic achievement in multiple content areas and their metacognitive reading strategies, along with demographic variables.

AB  - The aim of the research presented in this paper is to develop the measurement instrument that will enable the identification of pupils’ needs for involvement in the socio-pedagogical intervention based on the assessments of their parents. We present the Pupils’ Needs in the Area of Social-pedagogic Intervention—Parents’ Version, which is being developed as part of the Development of models of social-pedagogic interventions in elementary schools project, funded by The Education and Teacher Training Agency. The study was conducted on a sample of 2865 parents of third-, fifth- and seventh-graders, from 43 Croatian elementary schools. This paper presents the process of developing the final version of the Questionnaire, which achieves satisfactory metric characteristics (reliability, validity and objectivity). Using factor analysis, we found that the Questionnaire measures the pupils’ assessment of attitudes towards their education, obligations, peers, parents, teachers and material gain, as well as communicativeness, emotion control and responsibility in the behavior of pupils. We show that the developed Pupils’ Needs in the Area of Social-pedagogic Intervention Questionnaire—Parent’s Version appropriately differentiates pupils with behavioral difficulties from other pupils, while forming categories based on the pupils’ gender and age. Moreover, we find that, based on parents’ assessments, 13% of pupils have behavioral difficulties, which is in line with the pupils’ self-assessments.

AB  - This four year ethnographic and longitudinal study will examine family cultures and family life among 30 African American families and their children in a way that attempts to avoid an overly homogenized description of how urban families at risk manage challenges in daily life as they try to address the health problems of children with illnesses or disabilities. In investigating the nature of family life as this bears upon health outcomes for children with illnesses or disabilities, it is essential to recognize diversity even while identifying themes and issues that hold across cases, such as we have begun to identify in our research: (1) over-burdened or 'vulnerable caregivers' who are themselves suffering from serious, chronic illnesses; (2) dynamic 'caregiving teams' to support this burden of caregiving; (3) families dealing with 'multiple illness trajectories'; (4) significant family dramas associated with poverty and inner city residence that dominate family life; (5) child illness or disability as one sub-plot in the midst of more crucial family concerns; (6) resiliency, resources, and supports that 'buffer' hardships and suffering; and (7) the emergence of selves and identities that foreshadow future possibilities. In essence, this is a study of 'lives in motion' (Elder, 1998, p.8), building upon earlier research with 20 African American families who have children with special health care needs as well as the health care and school professionals who serve them. We are nesting our study of children within their primary social unit, the family, in recognition of the interrelatedness of the lives of children and their caregivers. We will assess how dynamic shifts in family life influence how multiple perspectives are negotiated. Our research questions are: How does familial caregiving change over time? How does the care of a child with special health care needs intersect with other family caregiving responsibilities? What are the shifting influences of larger community and extended family networks on caregiving? How do these factors impact upon and in turn influence the ability of families to access and create effective partnerships with health care professionals? The anticipated outcomes of this study are an emic understanding of: (a) a child's illness course) and how impairments influence developmental progress and achievements over time; (b) shifts in family structure, household configurations, caregiving patterns and their resources; (c) reconfigurations of parent (or parenting team)/child dyads in relation to the child's and caregiver's health changes; and (d) shifts in family priorities when juggling multiple illness trajectories among a number of family members as well as other key family issues. In addition, we will be identifying core curriculum content for intervention projects to improve cross cultural collaboration.

AB  - Sleep problems are common in school-age children and linked to numerous negative outcomes. Sleep disturbances are particularly common in children with mental health disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety. Despite frequent use of nonpharmacological pediatric sleep interventions to treat common sleep problems, there is a paucity of research on whether these interventions are effective. Further, it is unclear whether by targeting sleep, these interventions lead to broader improvements in the domains of functioning that are commonly affected by poor sleep. The present review includes 20 studies that evaluated nonpharmacological sleep treatments for school-aged youth, including 5 studies specifically focused on youth with externalizing or internalizing problems. Multimodal approaches consisting of psychoeducation and sleep hygiene in combination with other components were effective at treating insomnia and general sleep problems in typically developing samples. The addition of behavioral parent training to sleep interventions was effective for youth with externalizing problems, whereas incorporating cognitive strategies into sleep interventions for youth with internalizing problems was found to be ineffective. A variety of secondary outcomes were examined, with the strongest support emerging for improvement in anxiety and behavioral problems. Implications for clinical practice and future research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder has been linked to executive deficits by several authors. Considering its negative impact on the daily life of the autistic individual, interventions targeting it are judicious. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to verify the efficiency and methodology of existing studies on cognitive-behavioral interventions, as well as cognitive training programs, meant to improve executive functions of autistic individuals. Method: We consulted the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ERIC and FRANCIS databases. Only scientific articles in French and English were selected. The terms autism OR asperger OR pervasivedevelopmental disorder AND intervention OR program OR treatment AND executive function OR set shifting OR task switching OR cognitive control OR updating OR working memory have been used. Of 1093 known studies, only 18 meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: While most interventions show promising results, less than optimal methodology and lack of reproduction of interventions leave us unable to judge their true efficiency. Discussion: The systematic review, the first one except for error, looking at interventions having an impact on the executive functions in the autistic population reveals a lack of research on the subject. This systematic review is relevant to researchers and clinicians in the field as it highlights the lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials directly targeting FE in people with ASD. Reproduction of the presented studies remains necessary to bring more empirical evidence. In addition, as executive functions develop towards five years, it would be appropriate to extend the research to a population of preschool children in order to validate the possibility of preventing executive dysfunction in the autistic population.

Étant donné son impact négatif sur le fonctionnement quotidien de l’individu autiste, concernant notamment l’autonomie de ce dernier, il est pertinent de développer des interventions qui le ciblent. Objectif: L’objectif de cette revue systématique est de vérifier l’efficacité et la qualité méthodologique des études sur les programmes d’intervention cognitivo-comportementaux ou d’entraînement cognitif provoquant un changement des fonctions exécutives (FE) chez les individus atteints d’autisme. Méthode: Nous avons consulté les bases de données MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ERIC et FRANCIS. Seuls les articles scientifiques en français et en anglais ont été retenus. Un total de 1093 études a été répertorié. Seules 18 d’entre elles répondent aux critères d’inclusion et d’exclusion. Résultats: Bien que la plupart des interventions répertoriées obtiennent des résultats significativement positifs, une méthodologie sous-optimale et le manque de reproduction des interventions suggèrent de rester prudent par rapport à l’interprétation de ces résultats et empêchent également de se prononcer sur leur efficacité. Conclusion: Cette revue systématique, la première, sauf erreur, s’intéressant aux interventions ayant un impact sur les fonctions exécutives chez la population autistique révèle un manque de recherche sur le sujet.

AB  - Making the appropriate choice of numerical teaching tools adapted to patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), within the big diversity of Softwares or Applications, is extremely complicated for families, professionals and family caregivers. However, according to us, it is possible to facilitate this selection by focusing mostly on the rare tools essentially based on known and explicit scientific facts. First of all, this article will present various theoretical corpuses and elements of the scientific literature which were taken into account and integrated to develop the digital LearnEnjoy applications, designed for children with ASD. These LearnEnjoy applications allow patients with ASD to learn a very large number of skills.Moreover these applications aim at supplying real structured and progressive education textbooks. Secondly, we will explain how these applications are used, conversely, as essential basis of an innovative protocol of experimental research aiming at a better understanding of the 'atypical' cognitive development of school-age children with TSA, especially in the field of the executive functions. In the future, such a new scientific study should allow us to envisage creating innovativ remediation protocols for patients with ASD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the idea of spread of encoding as an explanatory principle in the development of free recall of words, in which the encoding of category-level word features increases the probability that these same features will be encoded for other same-category exemplars. The data of 2 experiments with 336 2nd graders and 2 experiments with 264 6th graders suggest that encoding of category-level features does not spread in elementary Ss' free recall. Using a mathematical model to estimate storage and retrieval difficulty, it was found that patterns of between-condition differences in storage and in retrieval did not suggest spread of encoding. In 2 experiments with 156 11th graders, data suggest that encoding of category-level features spreads in adolescent free recall.

AB  - This dissertation explored the effects of within-school consultation provided by mentors (i.e., veteran teachers) on new teachers' specific praise rates during teacher-directed instruction. Specific praise is an empirically-supported classroom management strategy associated with increases in desired academic and social student outcomes when implemented appropriately in classrooms. Unfortunately, new teachers often begin their careers without the background knowledge, strategies, or support to implement this strategy effectively and consistently. I investigated the effects of a within-school consultation intervention, which involved self-management, regular structured meetings, and focused performance feedback on new teachers' specific praise rates across three new teachers and their assigned mentors using a concurrent multiple-baseline across participants design. Specific praise rates increased for each new teacher when within-school consultation was implemented, indicating a functional relationship. In addition, students' on-task behavior increased during the intervention phase. Implications for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers are discussed in detail.

AB  - The under-representation of culturally, linguistically, and ethnically diverse (CLED) students in gifted programs has received increasing public attention during the last several years. Even though the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1988 focused on this population of children and called for research and educational reform to improve their education, little is known of nationwide programmatic efforts to address this challenge and find solutions. This study used mixed methodology to examine the successful interventions and practices used in programs nominated as exemplary for identifying and serving CLED students with gifts and talents. The programs included in this study represented all geographic regions of the United States, grades pre-K through 12, and various programming designs. The coordinators of 42 programs completed questionnaires and 25 programs were selected for follow-up telephone interviews, and in-depth case studies were completed. These data were analyzed to determine the exemplary practices used in successful gifted programs for CLED students. The results of this study suggest that more flexible identification procedures, support for students and parents, as well as consistent administrative support were critical to the successful participation of CLED students in gifted programs. The areas in need of additional attention were the evaluation procedures used, collaborative efforts between gifted education and ESL, and parent and community involvement.

AB  - Substantial research indicates decoding difficulties are a primary contributor to reading comprehension problems. Yet, far less is known about sources of reading comprehension problems when readers' decoding abilities are appropriate for grade level (i.e., specific reading comprehension difficulties; RCD). Executive functioning contributes uniquely to RCD beyond traditional predictors, such as decoding ability and vocabulary. However, of the three core executive functions, working memory and inhibition have received relatively more research attention than cognitive flexibility, even though readers with RCD typically focus inflexibly on decoding processes without attention to meaning. Two studies assessed the contribution of cognitive flexibility to RCD. Study 1 employed a matched sampling approach to examine general and reading-specific cognitive flexibility in 24 readers with RCD and 24 typically developing readers (from a pool of 140 students) at the end of 1st and 2nd grades. Readers with RCD were significantly lower in reading-specific cognitive flexibility than typically developing peers, even when decoding, verbal ability, nonverbal matrix reasoning ability, and vocabulary were controlled; a similar, though not significant, difference emerged for general, color-shape cognitive flexibility. Study 2 revealed a teacher-delivered cognitive flexibility intervention produced significant improvements in reading comprehension for students with RCD (n = 18) who had not shown significant growth prior to intervention; after intervention, their reading comprehension growth was comparable to typically developing controls (n = 21).

AB  - Young children may or may not notice implied behaviors and feelings displayed by parents and peers about other groups of people. Their racial attitudes significantly correlate with parents' racial attitudes when parents reported discussing those attitudes with their children (Katz and Kofkin, 1997). Teachers can be as effective as parents in helping to prevent children's development of racially biased attitudes (Frawley, 2008). They can use multicultural literature to expose students to ideas that might be unfamiliar to them. Additionally, teachers can use the images and text in picture books to conduct discussions with young children that are developmentally appropriate for their level of cognition. The study explored the effect of reading multicultural literature which features a primary African American character and holding positive, explicit discussion about African Americans following the reading on white preschoolers' racial attitudes. The Preschool Racial Attitude Measurement II (PRAM II) was administered to 16 four-year olds from two classrooms in a private preschool setting and provided pre and post test scores on racial attitudes in both the control and treatment groups. All children listened to two different literature selections which featured primary African American characters each week for four weeks. For the treatment group only, readings were followed with positive, explicit discussion about African Americans. Paired t-tests conducted on each groups' pre and post PRAM II scores showed a statistically significant difference in the treatment group's scores but not in the control group's; treatment group, t (7) = 3.86, p = .01, d = 1.37, control group, t (7) = 1.78, p = .12, d = .63. However, a paired t-test on post test scores from matched pairs composed of both groups did not show a statistically significant difference from the treatment, t (7) = .68, p = 0.52. This may have been because the control group's scores did increase slightly over the study period. An independent t-test on each group based on classroom placement did not show any significant impact from classroom conditions. Analyses of post reading discussion suggested that some children were able to recognize similarities (50% or more) and differences (25% or more) between themselves and the African American main characters. Although teachers reported feeling comfortable with discussions for 87% of the readings, they only conducted discussions as directed for 29% of readings, partially as directed for 57% of readings, and held no discussion for 14% of readings. These numbers suggest that teachers may benefit by participating in anti-bias education or that story readings and discussions should be less frequent than the study design.

AB  - Both Thompson and the duo of Confrey and Smith describe how students might be taught to build "ways of thinking" about exponential behavior by coordinating the covariation of two changing quantities, however, these authors build exponential behavior from different meanings of covariation. Confrey and Smith advocate beginning with discrete additive and multiplicative changes, while Thompson advocates beginning with continuous variation. In light of these differences, this work investigates the questions of how students actually reason covariationally, and what the consequences of their reasoning are for mathematics involving exponential functions. This work describes a teaching experiment, consisting of a series of fifteen task-based exploratory teaching interviews with two high school student participants. The purpose of the experiment was to identify the operations of covariational reasoning that the students actually used, and the consequences of that reasoning for mathematics involving exponential growth. The tasks covered linear functions, compound interest, phase plane, exponential growth, and the logistic differential equation. In the conceptual analysis of the participants' mathematical work and spoken utterances, I identified two ways of thinking about change that differ from the discrete/continuous dichotomy above: thinking about "chunky" completed changes, or a "smooth" change in progress. With smooth and chunky as a basis, I also identify five different ways of understanding exponential growth: Geometric, compound, differential, harmonic, and stochastic. Lastly, I suggest that powerful understandings of exponential growth come not from the mastery of any one way of thinking, but from a rapid and fluent shifting amongst several ways of thinking.

AB  - Somatostatin and other neuropeptides are expressed in tumors originating from neuronal precursors and paraganglia, namely medulloblastoma, central Primitive Neuro-Ectodermal Tumors (cPNETs), neurocytoma, gangliocytoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, paraganglioma. In medulloblastoma, the most common malignant tumor in childhood, there is an extensive expression of somatostatin in addition to somatostatin receptors (SSTR) type 2. Although density of SSTR-2 and intensity of expression of somatostatin genes have no prognostic significance in medulloblastoma, their presence may bring along important information on oncogenesis and relate medulloblastoma to cPNETs. Radio-labeled octreotide scintigraphy may be useful in the follow-up of these patients, allowing differentiation between scar and tumoral tissue. Moreover, on the basis of octreotide-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in medulloblastoma, a trial with octreotide in patients with recurrent or high-risk tumor is warranted. Meningiomas and low-grade astrocytic gliomas, even if not displaying a clear neuroendocrine phenotype, have high levels of SSTR-2. In meningiomas, SSTRs-scintigraphy is not part of the routine pre-operative assessment; moreover, a therapeutic trial with somatostatin-analogues in patients with recurrent or inoperable meningiomas should be carried-out with great caution, because somatostatin and octreotide slightly increase cell proliferation in cultured meningiomatous cells. Low-grade gliomas (WHO grade 2), and a smaller fraction of anaplastic astrocytomas, express SSTR-2, while glioblastomas usually do not. Unfortunately, radiolabeled-octreotide scintigraphy is not useful in the differential diagnosis of gliomas, because the results are altered by the disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB); in addition, radionuclide-labeled somatostatin analogues are not useful in the therapy of low-grade gliomas, because the intact BBB prevents them from reaching the target SSTR-2. Recently, a pilot study in gliomas, has proposed the use of a radio-labeled somatostostatin analogue with a loco-regional approach in order to overcome the intact BBB.

AB  - A number of training interventions have been designed to improve executive functions and inhibitory control (IC) across the lifespan. Surprisingly, no study has investigated the structural neuroplasticity induced by IC training from childhood to late adolescence, a developmental period characterized by IC efficiency improvement and protracted maturation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions involved in IC. The aim of the present study was to investigate the behavioral and structural changes induced by a 5‐week computerized and adaptive IC training in school‐aged children (10‐year‐olds) and in adolescents (16‐year‐olds). Sixty‐four children and 59 adolescents were randomly assigned to an IC (i.e. Color‐Word Stroop and Stop‐Signal tasks) or an active control (AC) (knowledge‐ and vocabulary‐based tasks) training group. In the pre‐ and posttraining sessions, participants performed the Color‐Word Stroop and Stop‐signal tasks, and an anatomical resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired for each of them. Children's IC efficiency improved from the pre‐ to the posttraining session in boys but not in girls. In adolescents, IC efficiency did not improve after IC training. Similar to the neuroplastic mechanisms observed during brain maturation, we observed IC training‐related changes in cortical thickness and cortical surface area in several PFC subregions (e.g. the pars opercularis, triangularis, and orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyri) that were age‐ and gender‐specific. Because no correction for multiple comparisons was applied, the results of our study provide only preliminary evidence of the complex structural neuroplastic mechanisms at the root of behavioral changes in IC efficiency from pre‐ to posttraining in school‐aged children and adolescents.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effect of activities developed in accordance with PDEODE teaching strategy on students' understanding of the particulate nature of matter. The sample of the study consists of the first grade students who study in the Primary School Teacher Education Program. In order to determine the conceptual change on students a test consisting of 8 questions was applied to the sample. This test was applied as pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test. The difference between the measurements was found statistically significant (p<0.05). This result shows that the treatment promotes the conceptual change and enhances students' conceptual understanding. As a result of a post-hoc test (Tukey HSD test) it was established that there is a statistically significant difference between the means of pre-test and post-test, and pre-test and delayed test (p<0.05), there isn't a significant difference between the means of post-test and delayed test (p>0.05).

AB  - We investigated the influence of exposure to phonologically similar words on four-year-olds' acquisition of novel object words. In Experiment I, hearing phonological neighbours BEFORE learning a new word did not influence children's novel word productions. In Experiment 2, when children heard the phonological neighbours of a novel word AFTER learning a new. word, they correctly, produced the target word more often than children. who did not receive this exposure. These findings suggest that exposing children to similar sounding words after a novel word was introduced may have helped maintain a representation of that word in working memory, leading to enhanced word learning.

AB  - Little is known about adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of the world’s HIV-positive adolescents reside. We assessed individual, household, and HIV self-management characteristics associated with a 48-hour treatment gap in the preceding 3 months, and a pharmacy medication possession ratio (MPR) that assessed the number of ART pills dispensed divided by the number of ART pills required in the past 6 months, among 285 Zambians, ages 15–19 years. Factors significantly associated with a 48-hour treatment gap were being male, not everyone at home being aware of the adolescent’s HIV status, and alcohol use in the past month. Factors associated with an MPR < 90% included attending the clinic alone, alcohol use in the past month, and currently not being in school. Findings support programs to strengthen adolescents’ HIV management skills with attention to alcohol use, family engagement, and the challenges adolescents face transitioning into adulthood, especially when they are no longer in school.

AB  - Social competence and social communication development can be concurrently supported through intentional thought and planning on the part of the early childhood special educator. In this article, we present suggestions for how teachers can effectively plan for and implement interventions to support these two areas, all within the context of play. The levels of play, awareness, exploration, and problem solving can be utilized by teachers to provide experiences for children, specifically those with language delays, to enhance and refine their social competence skills, while also furthering their language development. It is important for teachers to provide, to the extent possible, an environment that is arranged to allow for multiple opportunities to practice these skills, while also keeping in mind the child's preferences and interests. Implementation of the suggested strategies can support children with language delays, as well as their peers, in becoming more successful with using their social communication skills to appropriately navigate social situations within the context of play.

AB  - The most prevalent problems were faulty food habits, enuresis, temper tantrums, disturbances of sleep, disobedience, disturbances of speech, masturbation, thumb sucking, pugnacity, and hyperactivity. When the cases were checked, from two to five years after first contact, it was found that with some types of difficulty, every case had adjusted, while with others only a half or even fewer had adjusted. Temper tantrums, pugnacity, and hyperactivity were adjusted in less than half the cases. Certain difficulties, such as enuresis and disturbances of sleep, which are a matter of trouble or embarrassment to the parents showed a higher percentage of improved cases. The number of cases adjusted corresponds very closely with the number of parents who were cooperative. There are many difficulties in adjustment, due to the complexity of some types of difficulty, the limitations of environment, the attitudes of neighbors toward certain types of treatment (such as permitting a child to scream throughout a temper tantrum without attention), and lack of parental cooperation.

AB  - A central issue for forensic interviewers in children’s eyewitness testimony is assuring that their reports are credible and truthful without increasing false reports. It is important for researchers and the legal community to understand factors that influence children’s abilities to remember and report witnessed events and provide them with an environment that fosters truthful disclosures. Therefore, the current program of research aims to address some of the gaps in our understanding of how social and interpersonal factors may influence children’s willingness to disclose or conceal a theft. Specifically, in both studies in the program of research, children witnessed a transgressor (E1) steal $20 from a wallet. E1 then asked the children to lie and say that they did not take the money. Child age (7 to 13 years), as well as their willingness to disclose, when they chose to disclose, and the quality and accuracy of their testimonies were examined. In Study 1, children’s (N = 152) perceived feelings of the likeability of and their familiarity and comfort with a transgressor and with an interviewer (E2) were examined. Children who reported higher likeability scores with E1 were more likely to attempt to lie by concealing the theft and more willing to keep it a secret. Children who reported higher likeability scores with E2 were more likely to indirectly disclose the theft. While children’s willingness to attempt to lie decreased with age, younger children who told the truth reported higher feelings of likeability with the interviewer. In Study 2, the rapport-building phase of a forensic interview was experimentally manipulated to evaluate the effect of a novel, interactive approach to building rapport based on the relational aspects of rapport-building including mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination between child and interviewer (Interactional Rapport condition) compared to traditional, narrative practice of describing various experienced events (Narrative Practice Rapport condition). Children (N = 114) also completed a measure of rapport to indicate their subjective level of rapport with the interviewer. The main findings of Study 2 indicated that older children in the Interactional Rapport condition were significantly more likely to be truthful, disclose the transgression earlier, and give more details. Together, the results of the current program of research suggest that how children feel about and the interactions with the adults involved in misdeeds and subsequent interviews are important avenues to investigate when studying children’s disclosures. Additionally, results of Study 2 indicate that by expanding the traditional concept of verbal, narrative practice based rapport-building to consider the implementation of a new, interactive method of building rapport may have beneficial effects on children’s disclosures. The results of these studies have important implications not only for forensic interviewers and best practice guidelines, but also for adults who work with children in schools, the community, and in everyday situations where making children feel comfortable enough to disclose truthful reports is crucialAlternate abstract:Une question primordiale pour les enquêteurs judicaires dans les témoignages des enfants est de s'assurer que leurs témoignages sont crédibles et honnêtes sans augmenter les faux témoignages. Il est important pour les chercheurs et la communauté juridique de comprendre les facteurs qui influencent les capacités des enfants à se rappeler et à signaler les événements dont ils ont été témoins et de leur fournir un environnement qui favorise les témoignages honnêtes. Par conséquent, le programme de recherche actuel vise à combler certaines lacunes dans notre compréhension de la façon dont les facteurs sociaux et interpersonnels peuvent influencer la volonté des enfants à divulguer ou dissimuler un vol. Plus précisément, dans les deux études du programme de recherche, des enfants ont été témoins d'un transgresseur (E1) qui vole $20 d’un portefeuille. E1 a ensuite demandé aux enfants de mentir et de dire qu'il n'avait pas pris l'argent. L'âge des enfants (7 à 13 ans), ainsi que leur volonté de divulguer, quand ils ont choisi de divulguer, et la qualité et l'exactitude de leurs témoignages ont été examinés. Dans l'étude 1, les sentiments perçus chez les enfants (N = 152) concernant la sympathie, la familiarité et le confort avec un transgresseur et un intervieweur (E2) ont été examinés. Les enfants qui ont déclaré des perceptions de sympathie plus élevées avec E1 étaient plus susceptibles à tenter de mentir en cachant le vol et plus disposés à garder le secret. Les enfants qui ont déclaré des perceptions de sympathie plus élevées avec E2 étaient plus susceptibles de divulguer le vol indirectement. Alors que la volonté des enfants d'essayer de mentir a diminué avec l'âge, les enfants plus jeunes qui ont dit la vérité ont rapporté des sentiments plus élevés de sympathie avec l'intervieweur. Dans l'étude 2, la phase d'établissement de relations d'un entretien judiciaire a été manipulée expérimentalement pour évaluer l'effet d'une nouvelle approche interactive de l'établissement de relations basée sur les aspects relationnels, notamment l'attention mutuelle, la positivité et la coordination entre l'enfant et l'intervieweur (condition de rapport interactionnel) relativement à la pratique narrative traditionnelle de description de divers événements vécus (condition de rapport de pratique narrative). Les enfants (N = 114) ont également rempli une mesure de rapport pour indiquer leur niveau subjectif de lien avec l'intervieweur. Les principaux résultats de l'étude 2 ont indiqué que les enfants plus âgés dans la condition de rapport interactionnel étaient significativement plus susceptibles à être honnêtes, à divulguer la transgression plus tôt, et à donner plus de détails. Ensemble, les résultats du programme de recherche actuel suggèrent que la façon dont les enfants se sentent et les interactions avec les adultes impliqués dans les méfaits et les entretiens ultérieurs sont des pistes importantes à explorer lors de l'étude des révélations des enfants. De plus, les résultats de l'étude 2 indiquent qu'en élargissant le concept traditionnel de rapport verbal basé sur la pratique narrative pour envisager la mise en œuvre d'une nouvelle méthode interactive d'établissement de rapport peut avoir des effets bénéfiques sur les révélations des enfants. Les résultats de ces études ont des implications importantes non seulement pour les enquêteurs juridiques et les directives sur les meilleures pratiques, mais aussi pour les adultes qui travaillent avec les enfants dans les écoles, la communauté et dans des situations quotidiennes où il est essentiel de mettre les enfants à l'aise pour divulguer des témoignages honnêtes.

AB  - Although Computational Thinking (CT) is considered an essential 21(st) century skill, little is known about teaching CT to students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To address this gap in the research, we conducted a scoping review to identify those approaches promoting programming skills and/or CT in children aged 6-15 with ASD and/or ADHD. We also investigated which other skills were simultaneously fostered and examined the challenges and benefits reported in the interventions undertaken. Results indicate that fostering programming and/or CT in students with ASD and/or ADHD has a beneficial effect. CT-related skills acquired by such students were found to persist beyond the intervention period and were often associated with an improvement in student social-emotional competences.

AB  - According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), there has been a dramatic increase in the number of children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the last several years. School nursing interventions need to be developed, implemented, and evaluated to address complexities experienced by this population. The STARS curriculum (Social Empowerment Training and Responsibilities for Students with ADHD) is a nursing intervention designed to improve perceptions of scholastic competence, social acceptance, and behavioral conduct in preadolescents diagnosed with ADHD. It consists of eight sessions with the theme of social empowerment training woven throughout the curriculum. The support group concept, with children helping children, initiated dynamic conversation as the participants creatively problem-solved and developed solutions to their difficulties.

AB  - Context Despite recent studies that failed to show catastrophic effects of prenatal cocaine exposure, popular attitudes and public policies still reflect the belief that cocaine is a uniquely dangerous teratogen. Objective To critically review outcomes in early childhood after prenatal cocaine exposure in 5 domains: physical growth; cognition; language skills; motor skills; and behavior, attention, affect, and neurophysiology. Data Sources Search of MEDLINE and Psychological Abstracts from 1984 to October 2000. Study Selection Studies selected for detailed review (1) were published in a peer-reviewed English-language journal; (2) included a corn parison group; (3) recruited samples prospectively in the perinatal period; (4) used masked assessment; and (5) did not include a substantial proportion of subjects exposed in utero to opiates, amphetamines, phencyclidine, or maternal human immunodeficiency virus infection. Data Extraction Thirty-six of 74 articles met criteria and were reviewed by 3 authors. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data Synthesis After controlling for confounders, there was no consistent negative association between prenatal cocaine exposure and physical growth, developmental test scores, or receptive or expressive language. Less optimal motor scores have been found up to age 7 months but not thereafter, and may reflect heavy tobacco exposure. No independent cocaine effects have been shown on standardized parent and teacher reports of child behavior scored by accepted criteria. Experimental paradigms and novel statistical manipulations of standard instruments suggest an association between prenatal cocaine exposure and decreased attentiveness and emotional expressivity, as well as differences on neurophysiologic and attentional/affecive findings. Conclusions Among children aged 6 years or younger, there is no convincing evidence that prenatal cocaine exposure is associated with developmental toxic effects that are different in severity, scope, or kind from the sequelae of multiple other risk factors. Many findings once thought to be specific effects of in utero cocaine exposure are correlated with other factors, including prenatal exposure to tobacco, marijuana, or alcohol, and the quality of the child's environment. Further replication is required of preliminary neurologic findings.

AB  - Within the field of developmental science, there is a general agreement of the need to work together across academic disciplinary boundaries in order to advance the understandings of how to optimize child development and learning. However, experience also shows that such collaborations may be challenging. This paper reports on the experiences of bidirectional collaboration between researchers in a multidisciplinary research team and between researchers and stakeholders, in the first randomized controlled trial in Swedish preschool. The objective of the trial was to investigate the effects of two pedagogical learning strategies evaluating language, communication, attention, executive functions and early math. The interdisciplinary team includes researchers from early childhood education, linguistics, developmental psychology and cognitive neuro science. Educational researchers and theorists within the field of early childhood education in Sweden have during the last two decades mainly undertaken small-scale qualitative praxis-oriented and participative research. There is a widespread skepticism with regards to some of the core principles in controlled intervention methodologies, including a strong resistance towards individual testing of children. Consequently unanticipated disagreements and conflicts arose within the research team, as RCT methodology requires the measurement of effects pre and post the intervention. The aim of this article is to discuss the conditions for bidirectional collaboration both between researchers and stakeholders and between researchers in the research team. The findings illustrate strategies and negotiations that emerged in order to address ontological and epistemological controversies and disagreements. These include (a) the negotiation of research ethics, (b) making divergences visible and learning from each other, (c) using a multi-epistemological and methodological approach as a complement to the RCT design and (d) the negotiation of research problems that are shared between educators and researchers.

AB  - Objectives There has been increased attention to access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) at schools in developing countries, but a dearth of empirical studies on the impact. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of school-based WASH on pupil absence in Nyanza Province, Kenya, from 2007 to 2008. Methods Public primary schools nested in three geographical strata were randomly assigned and allocated to one of three study arms [water treatment and hygiene promotion (WT & HP), additional sanitation improvement, or control] to assess the effects on pupil absence at 2-year follow-up. Results We found no overall effect of the intervention on absence. However, among schools in two of the geographical areas not affected by post-election violence, those that received WT and HP showed a 58% reduction in the odds of absence for girls (OR 0.42, CI 0.21-0.85). In the same strata, sanitation improvement in combination with WT and HP resulted in a comparable drop in absence, although results were marginally significant (OR 0.47, 0.21-1.05). Boys were not impacted by the intervention. Conclusion School WASH improvements can improve school attendance for girls, and mechanisms for gendered impacts should be explored. Incomplete intervention compliance highlights the challenges of achieving consistent results across all settings. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Objetivos: Ha habido un aumento en la atención prestada al agua, la sanidad y la higiene (ASH) en los colegios de países en vías de desarrollo, pero una escasez de estudios empíricos sobre su impacto. Hemos realizado un ensayo aleatorizado por conglomerados en colegios con ASH sobre el ausentismo de los alumnos de la Provincia de Nyanza, Kenia, entre el 2007-2008. Métodos: Las escuelas públicas primarias dentro de tres estratos geográficos fueron asignadas de forma aleatoria a uno de los tres brazos del estudio (tratamiento del agua y promoción de la higiene, mejoras sanitarias adicionales, o control) para evaluar los efectos sobre el ausentismo de los alumnos tras dos años de seguimiento. Resultados: No encontramos un efecto general de la intervención en ausencia de los alumnos. Sin embargo, entre las escuelas en dos de las áreas geográficas no afectadas por la violencia posterior a las elecciones, aquellos que recibieron tratamiento del agua y promoción de la higiene mostraron una reducción del 58% en la probabilidad de ausentismo de las niñas (OR 0.42, CI 0.21-0.85). En el mismo estrato, la mejora sanitaria en combinación con el tratamiento del agua y la promoción de la higiene resultó en una caída comparable en el ausentismo, aunque los resultados eran marginalmente significativos (OR 0.47, 0.21-1.05). La intervención no tenía un impacto sobre los chicos. Conclusión: En los colegios con mejoras en ASH puede mejorar la participación de las niñas, y deberían investigarse mecanismos con impactos condicionados por el género. Un cumplimiento incompleto de la intervención pone de manifiesto los retos existentes para alcanzar resultados consistentes en todos los emplazamientos. (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Objectifs: Une attention croissante a été accordée à l'accès à l'eau, à l'assainissement et à l'hygiène dans les écoles des pays en développement, mais il y a un manque d'études empiriques sur l'impact. Nous avons mené un essai randomisé en grappes sur l'accès à l'eau, l'assainissement et l'hygiène en milieu scolaire, sur les absences des élèves, dans la province de Nyanza, au Kenya, de 2007 à 2008. Méthodes: Les écoles publiques primaires imbriquées dans trois strates géographiques ont été assignées aléatoirement et affectées à l'un des trois bras de l'étude (traitement de l'eau et promotion de l'hygiène, amélioration additionnelle de l'assainissement ou témoins) afin d'évaluer les effets sur les absences des élèves au bout de deux ans de suivi. Résultats: Nous n'avons trouvé aucun effet général de l'intervention sur les absences. Cependant, parmi les écoles dans deux des zones géographiques non touchées par la violence postélectorale, celles qui ont reçu un traitement de l'eau et la promotion de l'hygiène ont montré une réduction de 58% des chances pour les absences pour les filles (OR: 0.42; IC: 0.21 à 0.85). Dans la même strate, l'amélioration de l'assainissement en combinaison avec le traitement de l'eau et la promotion de l'hygiène a entraîné une baisse comparable des absences, même si les résultats étaient marginalement significatifs (OR: 0.47; IC: 0.21 à 1.05). Les absences des garçons n'ont pas été affectées par l'intervention. Conclusion: Les améliorations de l'accès à l'eau, l'assainissement et l'hygiène à l'école peuvent améliorer la fréquentation scolaire des filles et des mécanismes pour les impacts liés au sexe devraient être explorés. Le respect incomplet de l'intervention souligne les défis pour atteindre des résultats cohérents dans tous les cadres.

AB  - Résumé Les patients déficients mentaux légers, à l’instar des auteurs de violences sexuelles dits valides, sont accessibles aux changements sous réserve d’adaptation de nos outils thérapeutiques et communicationnels envers eux. Une double approche psychothérapeutique, psychodynamique et psychoéducative serait un atout majeur dans l’accompagnement de ces sujets pour réduire leur potentiel transgressif, en général, et en matière de passage à l’acte sexuel. Au-delà des représentations psychiques réduisant la sexualité de ces sujets aux seules démarches de contraception ou de prévention sanitaire, la question posée est essentiellement celle de l’expression de leur sexualité, de sa tolérance, de son ouverture vers l’autre et de la subjectivation du processus sexuel. Objectives We wanted to share our experience with a group of mentally retarded patients major supported on our network in the west of Paris specializes in working with perpetrators of sexual violence. These subjects reach us either by spontaneous demand for sexual fantasies haunting is addressed by educators from their homes or workplace concerned with inappropriate sexual behaviors, and it is often the case, following a duty of care in relation with a judgment for sexual assault. Patients or materials The sessions include a dozen regular participants, all middle-aged adults aged 45 and primary school level, four are unemployed, three workers in mainstream and the other half working in a protected environment. Two of them are unique son and the other variable in rank after the siblings ranging, two of them are separated from their partner and the rest all single and three each have a child. All benefit from disabled adult allowance and a measure of legal protection of property as guardianship. Only five subjects experienced periods of imprisonment of two months to five years, eight subjects are compulsory treatment ranging from one to five years, two under judicial supervision pending trial and five without prosecution. We see all kinds of acting out sexual fantasies. The majority of participants had some level of difficulty disharmony evolutionary adaptability in social life, a life limited to the circle of family or social care homes. Mature sex is virtually absent, substituted by masturbatory behavior more or less frequent. Three patients were sexually abused in childhood by a relative or someone you trust. Two cases of unknown fathers and abused two patients describe a deprivation and educational neglect. In contrast, the rest of the participants reported a family history and emotional climate unremarkable, except for a certain emotion in contact with social phobia manifest. Methods The therapeutic space dedicated to the care of the mentally retarded groupal perpetrators of sexual violence wants warm, empathetic and container. The therapeutic strategy is adapted to the cognitive abilities, attentional abilities and verbal comprehension of mentally retarded subjects. The information is concrete and less abstract for it to be better integrated and included with the media if required (drawings, anatomical charts, photos, mediated by educational tools such as “that told” and/or other equipment specially designed as our “Scale degrees of physical intimacy” [Nadège Robin, Hajbi Mathieu, France 2011]). Overall, the therapists involved in the critical exchanges between participants where lighting is required with a double approach: psychodynamic and psychoeducational. The psychodynamic approach is referred cathartic, introspective, inspirational affects overdue, projective identifications and fantasies in relation to object choice; whereas psychoeducational approach is for preventive strengthening the knowledge, expertise, knowledge being and impulse control… it is based, in turn, on educational explanations. Several levels of change are well appreciated in ascending chronological order (degree of recognition, Identification of risk situations, self-perceived psychological strategies of change), but their temporal stability is a key factor for ensuring a real capacity for change. Overall, the changes in the total population varies depending on the duration and quality sharing arrangement of the therapy and the level of involvement and intellectualization of each patient. Results We can highlight some difficulties, namely the search for sexual activity shared, lack of information about sexuality, lack of anticipation, representation, abstraction, verbalisation and inhibition of impulses. Therapeutic strategy to adopt is to put these subjects to control their sexual urges, direct their sexual desires appropriately and improve their ability to create interpersonal sexual, emotional and granted.

AB  - THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF FIVE VARIABLES (INITIAL INSTRUCTIONS, REWARD, LETTER SIZE, TYPE OF WARM-UP, AND FEEDBACK) ON KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN'S PERFORMANCE OF A LETTER DISCRIMINATION TASK. IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT ATTENTION IS THE KEY FACTOR IN LETTER DISCRIMINATION. THE PRESENT STUDY PROPOSES THAT A PRECONDITION TO SUCCESS BY CHILDREN IN LETTER DISCRIMINATION IS HAVING AN ADEQUATE CONCEPT OF "SAMENESS." THAT IS, IF THE CHILD IS NOT AWARE OF WHAT THE EXPERIMENTER MEANS BY THE WORDS "SAME" AND "DIFFERENT" IN A DISCRIMINATION TASK, ATTENTION IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT. EIGHTY KINDERGARTEN PUPILS WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE TEST CONDITIONS TO PERFORM THE DISCRIMINATION TASK. THE TASK METHODOLOGY CONSISTED OF PRESENTING A SINGLE LETTER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF A PIECE OF PAPER AND FOUR ROWS OF TEN LETTERS ON THE RIGHT SIDE. AMONG THESE 40 LETTERS WERE FIVE LETTERS IDENTICAL TO THE SINGLE LETTER, FIVE MOST LIKELY TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE SINGLE LETTER, AND 30 ADDITIONAL LETTERS. THE CHILD WAS ASKED TO IDENTIFY THE LETTERS IN THE FOUR ROWS THAT MATCHED THE SINGLE LETTER. THIS METHOD REPRESENTED TEST CONDITION ONE. THE REMAINING FOUR CONDITIONS WERE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS CONDITION ONE EXCEPT FOR VARIATIONS IN SCORING INSTRUCTION GIVEN (CONDITION TWO), USE OF REWARD (CONDITIONS THREE AND FIVE), AND TYPE OF WARM-UP (CONDITION FOUR). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT NEITHER VARIATION OF LETTER SIZE NOR SCORING INSTRUCTIONS HAD AN EFFECT ON PUPIL PERFORMANCE. THE FEEDBACK WAS EFFECTIVE, FOR IT HELPED THE PUPIL DEVELOP THE CONCEPT OF "SAMENESS" NECESSARY TO MAKE THE DISCRIMINATION. (WD)

AB  - Eight experiments are described in this report. In experiment 1, four and five year olds were presented four verbal discrimination (VD) lists. For three of the lists all correct items were either conceptually, acoustically, or affectively similar. The fourth was a control list. The conceptual list facilitated VD learning. Experiment 2 indicated that recognition memory (RM) by kindergartners for target items was better when those items had been preceded by associates than when they had not. In experiment 3, three and four year olds were given extensive paired-associate (PA) training in which response terms were highly familiar words and stimulus terms were words semantically related to response terms but unfamiliar to the subjects. The feasibility of using an entirely verbal PA task with children was demonstrated. Experiment 4 examined the effects of the categorizability of words to be remembered on free recall (FR) of children three through six. In experiment 5 preschool and young elementary school children were given five FR study-test trials with a nine-word list. Experiment 6 consisted of the collection and compilation of word association data for preschoolers. Experiments 7 and 8 examined the modifiability of memory encoding operations of preschoolers and used training exercises to increase the children's awareness of conceptual relationships. (WR)

AB  - The purpose of this research was to determine if students’ gender, grade level, and level of creativity have an impact on their use of mathematical problem solving strategies and solution methods when given a nonroutine problem. The number and complexity of the solutions obtained by students who participated in problem solving instruction were compared to those of students receiving no instruction. The degree of complexity of solution methods was assessed and ranked by specialists in mathematical problem solving and was based on the level of understanding and generalizability of the method. The relationship between creativity and solutions found was also explored. In the winter of 2008-2009, data were collected from 170 sixth and seventh grade students in Middle Tennessee. A quasi-experimental design was used. The students were divided into four groups based on current classroom grouping. The treatment classes lasted for six weeks and were designed to elicit multiple solution methods for a single problem. Those who experienced problem solving instruction had both higher solution numbers and higher levels of complexity in both the sixth and seventh grades. There was no significant difference in the number or complexity of solution methods by grade level. There was a difference in the number of solution methods by gender at the sixth grade level. Sixth grade girls had higher numbers of solutions than sixth grade boys. In seventh grade, there was no difference in the number of solutions obtained by gender. There was no relationship between the complexity of solution methods and gender at either grade level. A relationship was not found between creativity scores and the number or complexity of student solutions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The diagnosis and monitoring of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) typically relies on subjective reports and observations. Objective continuous performance tests (CPTs) have been incorporated into some services to support clinical decision making. However, the feasibility and acceptability of adding such a test into routine practice is unknown. The study aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of adding an objective computerised test to the routine assessment and monitoring of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians (n = 10) and families (parents/young people, n = 20) who participated in a randomised controlled trial. Additionally, the same clinicians (n = 10) and families (n = 76) completed a survey assessing their experience of the QbTest. The study took place in child and adolescent mental health and community paediatric clinics across the UK. Interview transcripts were thematically analysed. Results: Interviewed clinicians and families valued the QbTest for providing an objective, valid assessment of symptoms. The QbTest was noted to facilitate communication between clinicians, families and schools. However, whereas clinicians were more unanimous on the usefulness of the QbTest, survey findings showed that, although the majority of families found the test useful, less than half felt the QbTest helped them understand the clinician’s decision making around diagnosis and medication. The QbTest was seen as a potentially valuable tool to use early in the assessment process to streamline the care pathway. Although clinicians were conscious of the additional costs, these could be offset by reductions in time to diagnosis and the delivery of the test by a Healthcare Assistant. Conclusions: The findings indicate the QbTest is an acceptable and feasible tool to implement in routine clinical settings. Clinicians should be mindful to discuss the QbTest results with families to enable their understanding and engagement with the process. Further findings from definitive trials are required to understand the cost/benefit; however, the findings from this study support the feasibility and acceptability of integrating QbTest in the ADHD care pathway.

AB  - Math computation is a foundational skill for students developing higher-level mathematics problem-solving skills and represents a primary deficit for students struggling in mathematics. Students with mathematics difficulties also tend to have difficulties with other executive functions. One domain that is systematically part of most mathematical computation tasks but is not directly related to mathematics is handwriting. Handwriting fluency serves as a proxy for fine motor and domain-general cognitive functions (like executive functions) that are important for math fact fluency, yet handwriting carries very little domain-specific skill on its own. Handwriting can potentially be used to partial out the aspects of fact fluency that are not domain specific. In the current study, we tested the robustness of basic fact fluency in relation to general math fluency when accounting for handwriting. Third-grade students (N = 144) participated in the current study with measures of handwriting, basic fact fluency, and general math fluency taken at pretest prior to an intervention. We found that basic math fact fluency was a robust predictor of general math fluency across quantiles of the outcome distribution. Handwriting fluency did not improve model predictive performance beyond basic fact fluency. Limitations, as well as implications for future research and practice, are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The global expansion of higher education has brought about more ambitious educational goals that require new approaches to curriculum, teaching, and learning. While higher education in East Asia is no exception to this trend, it has been observed that both teachers and learners in the region have adhered to a strong tradition of lecture-based instruction. An underlying research question concerned the responsiveness of East Asian students to learner-centered education. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which learner-centered education can be implemented successfully in the East Asian higher education context. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a quantitative study informed by a description of the context for implementation. It adopts a quasi-experimental, multiple time series design and examines the process and effects of change in teaching and learning at a graduate school of business (GSB) in Thailand. The GSB implemented a variety of active learning methods that were explicitly designed to increase student engagement. Descriptive statistics, as well as mixed effects models, were used to analyze student course evaluation data over a several year period. Findings: Active learning methods could be implemented in the context of an East Asian high education institution and they entailed positive change in student engagement over time. Originality/value: The paper's results support assertions that Asian students respond positively to well-designed instructional methods that seek to foster active learning.

AB  - The effects of classroom noise and background speech on speech perception, measured by word-to-picture matching, and listening comprehension, measured by execution of oral instructions, were assessed in first-and third-grade children and adults in a classroom-like setting. For speech perception, in addition to noise, reverberation time (RT) was varied by conducting the experiment in two virtual classrooms with mean RT = 0.47 versus RT = 1.1 s. Children were more impaired than adults by background sounds in both speech perception and listening comprehension. Classroom noise evoked a reliable disruption in children's speech perception even under conditions of short reverberation. RT had no effect on speech perception in silence, but evoked a severe increase in the impairments due to background sounds in all age groups. For listening comprehension, impairments due to background sounds were found in the children, stronger for first-than for third-graders, whereas adults were unaffected. Compared to classroom noise, background speech had a smaller effect on speech perception, but a stronger effect on listening comprehension, remaining significant when speech perception was controlled. This indicates that background speech affects higher-order cognitive processes involved in children's comprehension. Children's ratings of the sound-induced disturbance were low overall and uncorrelated to the actual disruption, indicating that the children did not consciously realize the detrimental effects. The present results confirm earlier findings on the substantial impact of noise and reverberation on children's speech perception, and extend these to classroom-like environmental settings and listening demands closely resembling those faced by children at school.

AB  - Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a childhood onset disorder marked by persistent, developmentally inappropriate symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, or both that impair functioning to a marked degree. Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) exhibit a number of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities that are the direct result of the disorder itself, in school-aged children. The knowledge of their cognitive functioning may help us to set objectives for planning treatment goals and improving their social, academic and personal functioning. Aims: The aim of the study was to find out cognitive functioning: working memory, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning and processing speed among ADHD and comparing with normal children. Settings and Design: Using purposive sampling technique, 30 children diagnosed with ADHD were compared with 30 normal children. Materials and Methods: Screened on Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM) for intelligence and ADHD-Symptom checklist (ADHD SC-4) for symptom severity of attention deficit and hyperactivity, all the subjects were assessed on the Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC) to see the cognitive functioning of both the groups of children. Results: ADHD children performed significantly different as compared to normal control on Information, General comprehension, Similarities, Arithmetic, Digit span, Picture completion, Coding and Mazes subtests of MISIC. Findings showed overall there was a significant difference between ADHD and normal children's performance on four major cognitive domains, viz. verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory and processing speed. Conclusions: Overall, children with ADHD have poor cognitive functioning compared to normal children.

AB  - The current investigation evaluates a peer-tutoring program called Promoting Achievement and Success at School (PASS) developed for students at the secondary school level, who have learning disabilities. The PASS program uses a strategy-based model of teaching higher-order cognitive strategies to adolescents, using a scaffolding approach. The first objective of the study was to examine whether students in the PASS program would outperform control participants on measures of grades, writing skills, numerical operations, and self-ratings of metacognitive awareness, strategy use, motivation/effort and academic self-concept using a randomized experimental design. The results indicated that the PASS students showed a significant improvement in their writing skills compared to control participants by the end of the study, while other areas, such as overall grades, did not show an improvement. The second objective of the study was to explore process factors, such as students' motivation and the relationship between tutor and tutee, to determine whether certain conditions, traits, skills or dynamics were more conducive to academic gains than others. Overall, there were characteristics of both tutors and tutees that predicted better outcomes for the tutees involved in the PASS study. First, tutors who were on task according to their tutees had tutees who made more academic gains. Second, tutees with higher metacognitive skills were more likely to have ii bonded with their tutors and were the students who asked more questions during tutoring. Additionally, students who made gains in their metacognitive skills and who had higher self-ratings of motivation and effort, rated themselves as making gains in their academic abilities by the end of the program. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of competence among adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) who participated in a virtual supported self-advocacy programme within the risk and protective paradigm. The sample consisted of 374 adolescents with and without learning disabilities, students of the 7th to 9th grades, at 15 schools across Israel. The adolescents were divided into three groups, matched by age and gender: 111 adolescents with LD who participated in a five-month virtual-supported intervention, and two comparison groups: adolescents with LD (N = 115) who did not participate in the program and adolescents without LD (N = 148). The self-perceptions of adolescents were assessed using the following questionnaires: basic psychological skills (competence and relatedness); hope and loneliness. Following the intervention, higher competence scores were reported by students with LD who participated in the programme. At that time (the end of the academic year), the predictors of the groups of students with LD for the competence measure were their level of competence at the beginning of the period, their belonging to the group who participated in the intervention, their loneliness and hope. Comparisons with predictors of the group of students without LD, and with predictors of competence at the beginning of the year, emphasized the importance of risk factors (loneliness) and the protective factors (hope) for students with LD. In addition, the results focused attention at the contribution of the participation in an e-supported self advocacy programme for enhancing competence among students with LD.

AB  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has become a common diagnosis among children today. The numbers have grown exponentially in the last several decades and, despite extensive research and various treatment modalities, many children continue to struggle with its disruptive symptoms. Current research reports a poor prognosis for this population with difficulties continuing into adulthood. One of the difficulties noted is in their ability to develop intrinsic motivation when their behaviors have been managed by extrinsic rewards. Self Determination Theory (SDT) was used to conceptualize the difficulties around developing intrinsic motivation when an individual experiences symptoms of ADHD which impact several areas of functioning. SDT asserts that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are needed in order to develop intrinsic motivation. As such, it was hypothesized that ADHD symptoms and their treatment may be related to motivational difficulties in children with ADHD. The General Scale of the Children's Academic Intrinsic Motivation Inventory was used to measure the intrinsic motivation of fourth and fifth graders, with and without ADHD, to explore possible differences in intrinsic motivation between groups. A total of 366 recruitment packets were sent home to families and resulted in 61 participants between the ages of 9-11. Test administration occurred within several elementary schools with the support of school principals and guidance counselors. The results of this research yielded only one statistically significant finding which illuminated a relationship of medium significance between age and intrinsic motivation. The lack of results in all other analyses indicate that there is no difference between the development of intrinsic motivation in children with ADHD when compared to their same-age peers. However, due to a small sample size, uneven diagnostic group distribution and the use of a subscale instead of a full measure, this study holds a low power of effect and the results should not be generalized to the population. In considering the numerous limitations of this study, the primary recommendations for future research are replication with a larger sample size and use of the entire CAIMI measure for a more comprehensive data set.

AB  - Background: From the perspective of dyslexia, familial risk is the issue most researched worldwide. The familial risk has never been studied in Poland. Results of many studies conducted in Europe, the U.S. and Australia show that children who have a close family member with dyslexia are at greater risk of this disorder than children in the control groups. This conclusion is backed up by the results of research on the genetic aetiology of learning disorders. In the presented study on Polish 1st grade students, the Adult Reading History Questionnaire by Lefly and Pennington (2000) in the Polish adaptation (ARHQ-PL) was used. The connections between the familial risk and the level of reading, spelling, phonological abilities and other cognitive functions were analysed. Participants and procedure: The study covered 513 children, including their parents, from randomly selected primary schools in the Mazowieckie province. According to the ARHQ-PL assumptions, the children’s parents were divided into groups taking into account the familial risk level. Children were individually assessed for reading, spelling, phonological abilities, naming speed, phonological memory, vocabulary level and selective attention. Inter-group comparisons were performed based on the analysed variables for the groups of children whose parents had critical results in the ARHQ. The comparisons identified high risk (or lack of risk), as per sex, age, education level and SES (socio-economical status). Results: The results show that there is a significant connection between risk group membership and the level of reading and of the majority of assessed phonological abilities. More significant relationships were determined for the familial risk of dyslexia observed for mothers. Conclusions: The study confirms the diagnostic accuracy of the familial dyslexia risk ratio determined using the ARHQ-PL questionnaire for reading and for the majority of the phonological abilities closely connected with reading. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the prognostic accuracy of diagnosing developmental dyslexia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this article is to show the importance of the early multisensorial stimulation and parental communication with the child in the development of language in infancy. We present a synthesis of the main theoretical approaches and results of the investigation on linguistic development, with special attention to the biological and neuroanatomic bases of the acquisition of language. The plasticity of childhood development and early interventions increased by the parents through their verbal and gestual interactions, can improve the child's linguistic competency from birth. For that reason the Multisensorial Estitsologic Method is proposed. Its effectiveness has been empirically evaluated by means of a quasiexperimental design with an experimental group and a control group (formed by 478 Spanish children of 0 to 6 years). After the stimulating intervention significant progresses in their level of-acquisition and development of language are achieved. These results are taken as departure point for a further analysis.

AB  - The use of technology, which is linked to active learning strategies, can contribute to better outcomes in Mathematics education. We analyse the conditions that are necessary for achieving an effective learning of Mathematics, aided by a robotic platform. Within this framework, the question raised was "What are the conditions that promote effective active math learning with robotic support?" Interventions at different educational scenarios were carried in order to explore three educational levels: elementary, secondary, and high school. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed, comparing the control and treatment groups for all scenarios through examinations, direct observations, and testimonials. The findings point to three key conditions: level, motivation, and teacher training. The obtained results show a very favourable impact on the attention and motivation of the students, and they allow for establishing the conditions that need to be met for an effective relationship between the teacher and the technological tool, so that better learning outcomes in Mathematics are more likely to be obtained.

AB  - This study examined the impact of studying on story comprehension and recall among children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants in the study were 36 children with ADHD and 43 nonreferred comparison children ages 7 to 11. The participants listened to 1 of 2 folktales and recalled the story both before and after studying a written version of the story for up to 10 min. The stories had been divided into individual events, and each event was coded for the number of causal connections it had to other story events. Each event was presented on a separate page of the study booklet so that time spent on each event could be recorded. All of the transcribed recalls were coded for which story events the participant correctly recalled. For both groups, recall increased as the number of causal connections increased, but the effect of the number of causal connections on recall was stronger for comparison children than for children with ADHD. The results revealed no group differences in studying behavior. However, when recall before studying was included as a predictor of recall after studying, studying was found to be more effective for higher IQ comparison children than for higher IQ children with ADHD, especially at the highest levels of causal connections. The results offer important leads for the development of academic interventions that are specific to the story-comprehension deficits of children with ADHD.

AB  - This project would experimentally evaluate a comprehensive, low-cost intervention involving parent and teacher training in child behavior management and child training in social skills to reduce early conduct problems, one of the major predictors of later drug abuse. By using programs that build on and complement each other, the intervention is designed to maximize the benefits of ensuring a consistent approach between home and school. In addition, by using a low-cost and easily implemented intervention, the likelihood that the intervention could be replicated widely is maximized. One-hundred and eighty children exhibiting high levels of conduct problems in kindergarten will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control classroom in first grade. Additionally, 120 teachers will be randomly assigned to receive intensive training in classroom management strategies and in implementing a classroom social skills program, or to serve as a one- year wait-list control. Teachers assigned to immediate intervention will receive six days of video-based group training in effective classroom management strategies Additionally, these teachers will implement a video-based classroom-wide social problem-solving and social skills program. Parents of the participating children assigned to intervention classrooms will also receive a video-based self- administered parent training program and brief consultation with a therapist. Outcome analyses will primarily focus on children's conduct problems and teachers' behaviors, and secondarily on children's social skills, school records, and utilization of medical and psychological services. In addition, a longitudinal model of the prediction of conduct problems at school and (in potential renewals of this project) of drug abuse itself will be tested, including in the model child factors such as early conduct problems, attention problems, reading ability, and social skills, and contextual variables such as parenting skill and teacher use of positive reinforcement and effective discipline. Finally, cost-benefit analyses of the intervention will also be performed.

AB  - Background: Deficits in executive function, including measures of working memory, inhibition and cognitive flexibility, have been documented in preschoolers born very low birth weight (VLBW) compared with preschoolers born normal birth weight (NEW). Maternal verbal scaffolding has been associated with positive outcomes for both at-risk and typically developing preschoolers. Aims: The purpose of this study was to examine associations between maternal verbal scaffolding, Verbal IQ (VIQ) and executive function measures in preschoolers born VLBW. Subjects: A total of 64 VLBW and 40 NBW preschoolers ranging in age from 3 1/2 to 4 years participated in the study. Outcome measures: VIQ was measured with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition. Executive function tests included the Bear Dragon, Gift Delay Peek, Reverse Categorization and Dimensional Change Card Sort-Separated Dimensions. Study design: Maternal verbal scaffolding was coded during a videotaped play session. Associations between maternal verbal scaffolding and preschoolers' measures of VIQ and executive function were compared. Covariates included test age, maternal education, and gender. Results: Preschoolers born VLBW performed significantly worse on VIQ and all executive function measures compared to those born NBW. Maternal verbal scaffolding was associated with VIQ for VLBW preschoolers and Gift Delay Peek for the NBW group. Girls born VLBW outperformed boys born VLBW on VIQ and Bear Dragon. Conclusion: Integrating scaffolding skills training as part of parent-focused intervention may be both feasible and valuable for early verbal reasoning and EF development.

AB  - Studied the application of the strategy of awarding affection (i.e., the strategy of handling affectively teaching materials which contain median affective factors) in a field experiment. The Ss were 2 classes of 2nd-yr high school students. Ss were randomly assigned into an experimental class and a control class for a physics class on Lenz's rule taught by a physics teacher with 30 yrs teaching experience and cartoon drawing skills. Ss in the control class received the teacher's traditional instruction and experimental demonstrations and Ss in experimental class were taught by the teacher with instruction, experimental demonstrations, and additional illustrations using the teacher's original cartoons. Before and after the class, Ss were tested for class-content cognition and class-learning emotions referring to attention, thinking, passion for learning, emotional experience, affection, and class atmosphere. The test results were studied with t test and compared between classes. The results prove that science teaching material which contain median affective factors can be handled with the strategy of awarding affection; the strategy can directly promote Ss' cognitive learning and positive learning development and can improve teaching quality.

AB  - Context: Physical activity can improve cognitive and mental health, but the underlying mechanisms have not been established. Objective: To present a conceptual model explaining the mechanisms for the effect of physical activity on cognitive and mental health in young people and to conduct a systematic review of the evidence. Data Sources: Six electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Ovid Medline, SportDiscus, and Embase) were used. Study Selection: School-, home-, or community-based physical activity intervention or laboratory-based exercise interventions were assessed. Studies were eligible if they reported statistical analyses of changes in the following: (1) cognition or mental health; and (2) neurobiological, psychosocial, and behavioral mechanisms. Data Extraction: Data relating to methods, assessment period, participant characteristics, intervention type, setting, and facilitator/delivery were extracted. Results: Twenty-five articles reporting results from 22 studies were included. Mechanisms studied were neurobiological (6 studies), psychosocial (18 studies), and behavioral (2 studies). Significant changes in at least 1 potential neurobiological mechanism were reported in 5 studies, and significant effects for at least 1 cognitive outcome were also found in 5 studies. One of 2 studies reported a significant effect for self-regulation, but neither study reported a significant impact on mental health. Limitations: Small number of studies and high levels of study heterogeneity. Conclusions: The strongest evidence was found for improvements in physical self-perceptions, which accompanied enhanced self-esteem in the majority of studies measuring these outcomes. Few studies examined neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms, and we were unable to draw conclusions regarding their role in enhancing cognitive and mental health.

AB  - A considerable body of research indicates that children's executive function (EF) skills and related school readiness constructs are important for early learning and long-term academic success. This review focuses on EF and a related construct, motor skills with a focus on visuo-motor integration, as being foundational for learning, and describes how these skills co-develop in young children in bidirectional and synergistic ways. The review discusses definitional and conceptual issues, connects EF and visuo-motor integration to relevant theoretical perspectives, discusses measurement issues and advancements, and reviews intervention evidence to support the malleability of these skills in young children. Discussion emphasizes how these skills develop together and suggests that research examining children's learning from a co-development perspective can help promote children's health and well-being.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to characterize the system of beliefs that make up the naive impetus theory of motion and to determine what effects physics instruction has on students' conceptions of motion. Thirteen college students were asked to solve several quantitative problems and were interviewed about their answers in the first experiment. Results indicate that these subjects held an impetus conception of motion. Three of these impetus-related misconceptions are discussed (curvilinear impetus belief, resistance to gravity, and straight-down belief). In the second experiment, high school students' (N=60) concepts of motion were examined before and after they took a physics course. Results suggest that instruction often corrects some of the gross misconceptions about how moving objects behave, but may leave others unaltered. In addition, instruction frequently fails to alter students' impetus beliefs about why moving objects behave as they do. These findings suggest the need to discuss the impetus view of motion, explaining precisely how this view differs from the Newtonian view. In addition, resistance to gravity and straight-down beliefs should be taught. Physics courses should also emphasize student understanding of the fundamentals of qualitative principles of mechanics, even if this means teaching less about the quantitative formalizations of these principles.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article was to understand the experience of speech impairment {speech sound disorders) in everyday life as described by children with speech impairment and their communication partners. Method: Interviews were undertaken with 13 preschool children with speech impairment (mild to severe) and 21 significant others (family members and teachers). Results: A phenomenological analysis of the interview transcripts revealed 2 global themes regarding the experience of living with speech impairment for these children and their families. The first theme encompassed the problems experienced by participants, namely (a) the child's inability to 'speak properly,' (b) the communication partner's failure to 'listen properly,' and (c) frustration caused by the speaking and listening problems. The second theme described the solutions participants used to overcome the problems. Solutions included (a) strategies to improve the child's speech accuracy (e.g., home practice, speech-language pathology) and (b) strategies to improve the listener's understanding (e.g., using gestures, repetition). Both short- and long-term solutions were identified. Conclusion: Successful communication is dependent on the skills of speakers and listeners. Intervention with children who experience speech impairment needs to reflect this reciprocity by supporting both the speaker and the listener and by addressing the frustration they experience.

AB  - Survivors of suicide are not alone. It is estimated every suicide leaves behind at least six survivors, creating approximately 200,000 new survivors in the United States every year. In 2005, one in every 65 Americans was a suicide survivor. Unfortunately there are no data available on the specific number of children and adolescent survivors, although we know there are many. Research on children and suicide has focused primarily on prevention of the suicide act; however, recently, more attention has been directed toward survivors and how to help those left behind. This chapter reviews the impact of a suicidal death in the family on child and adolescent survivors, and discusses the special challenges, including complicated and disenfranchised grief associated with suicidal deaths. Case vignettes of children and adolescents at different developmental stages illustrate typical responses and treatment approaches. Of the thousands bereaved by suicide, it has been found that bereaved children and adolescents are at increased risk for developing psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic and conduct disorders. Children bereaved by suicide may have greater difficulty dealing with peers at school and in other social settings. Additionally, bereaved children and adolescents have been found to be at greater risk for complicated grief (CG) and for committing suicide themselves.

AB  - Research Findings: Exuberant temperament, characterized by high approach and positive affect, is linked to socioemotional outcomes including risk of externalizing symptoms across development. Externalizing problems interfere with children's school readiness and lead to disruptive behavior in the classroom. While some moderating factors help identify which exuberant children are at risk and in which contexts they are at risk, few studies have identified early moderators that protect against maladjustment when children enter school. In the current study, we examined exuberant temperament in 124 toddlers and classroom behavior problems reported by kindergarten teachers. We also assessed the impact of maternal responsiveness at 24months on the relation between exuberance and classroom behavior problems. As hypothesized, we found that higher exuberance predicted more behavior problems. In addition, maternal responsiveness moderated this association such that high responsiveness protected exuberant children from classroom behavior problems.Practice or Policy: These results expand our understanding of socioemotional risks for exuberant children and how these risks influence school readiness. We also find that maternal responsiveness during toddlerhood mitigates these risks, and our findings suggest that interventions for exuberant children at risk for behavior problems or poor school readiness should target parental responsiveness when children are toddlers.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined short-term predictive associations between 5 different types of parent verbal responsiveness and later spoken vocabulary for 32 young children with a confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Method: Parent verbal utterances were coded from videotapes of naturalistic parent-child play sessions using interval and event-based coding. A vocabulary difference score, calculated using the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (L. Fenson et al., 1993), was used as the outcome measure of spoken vocabulary 6 months later. Results: Parent follow-in comments and follow-in directives predicted spoken vocabulary after controlling for child engagement. Parent expansions of child verbal utterances predicted spoken vocabulary after controlling for child talkativeness. When entered together into a regression analysis, metrics that represented (a) the number of parent utterances following into the child's focus of attention and (b) the number of parent utterances responding to child verbal communication acts both accounted for unique variance in predicting change in spoken vocabulary from Time 1 to Time 2. Conclusion: Parent verbal utterances that follow into the child's current focus of attention or respond to child verbal communication acts may facilitate the process of early vocabulary acquisition by mitigating the need for children with ASD to use attention-following as a word-learning strategy.

AB  - This study analyzed the processes used by students when engaged in modeling activities and examined how students' abilities to solve modeling problems changed over time. Two student populations, one experimental and one control group, participated in the study. To examine students' modeling processes, the experimental group participated in an intervention program consisting of a sequence of six modeling activities. To examine students' modeling abilities, the experimental and control groups completed a modeling abilities test on three occasions. Results showed that students' models improved as they worked through the sequence of problem activities and also revealed a number of factors, such as students' grade, experiences with modeling activities, and modeling abilities that influenced their modeling processes. The study proposes a three-dimensional theoretical model for examining students' modeling behavior, with subsequent implications for the teaching and learning of mathematical problem solving.

AB  - Advances in neuro-oncology have resulted in dramatic increases in the survival of children with pediatric brain tumors, including those with medulloblastoma, the most common early childhood central nervous system (CNS) malignancy. Because of this increased survival, there is heightened awareness and recognition that an understanding of the impact of treatments and interventions on children's development, learning, and adaptive behaviors is essential for optimization of long-term outcomes. One of the major reasons for studying these outcomes is that the developing nervous system has its unique vulnerabilities with respect to the primary tumor, its complications (hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, hazards of tumor resection), and the late effects of treatments on children's developmental, learning, and adaptive status. In addition, very young children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of radiation and other therapies, highlighting the importance of measuring emerging communication, coordination, and social adaptive skills. Lastly, there is increased concern about the long-term consequences of chemotherapy on specific neural populations and neural connectivity that affect memory, learning, and executive function. The purpose of this article is to review ways of conceptualizing CNS adaptive functioning in children diagnosed with brain tumors in early childhood. The international classification of functioning (ICF) model will be used to describe the spectrum of health and developmental outcomes of child neurodisability. An integrated strategy of surveillance for motor, communicative, and adaptive skills that can be linked to neuropsychological assessments will also be highlighted. This health, development, and functional surveillance framework will help us better evaluate how our management impacts on child and family well-being and how our interventions lessen severe multiple motor, communicative, and neurobehavioral morbidities.

AB  - For parents, academic achievement is an important part of their child's development. Generally, parents, teachers and the community are expected to play a supporting role in learning, yet many students struggle in an educational system some believe is in crisis (Dunlosky, Rawson, Marsh, Nathan, & Willingham, 2013). Low-income minority youth are particularly at risk for negative outcomes, such as higher absence rates in school and lower achievement scores (Hochschild, 2003; Zhang, 2003), as compared to suburban White middle/upper-income youth. This study aimed to examine the feasibility of implementing the SAFE-Learning intervention, an adaptation of the Family Check Up, with urban public school families and to understand family protective and risk factors. Sixty-four urban public school children between 5-18 years old (M = 12.28, SD = 3.53) and their parents (M age = 43.34, SD = 9.82) consented to participate. Sixty-two children were African American (97%), 26 were boys (41%), and 22 families reported an income < 10,000 (34%). Both the parent and child completed assessment measures examining protective and risk factors in the first session. The second visit included the utilization of motivational interviewing to review scores and set goals with the parent and child. Results across 11 domains revealed families presented with a high average of strengths (M = 7.47, SD = 2.14). Boys were found to feel less self-efficacious in their ability to learn as compared to girls and both parent-teacher involvement and self-regulation for learning were significantly lower for high schoolers. Sixty-three dyads created 3 goals and identified potential barriers. Results provide initial promise for the feasibility of implementing the SAFE-Learning intervention with both the parent and child across various developmental periods with low-income, urban public school families. However, it is important to consider that only a small number of hundreds of urban public school children and their families participated in the study. To better understand how to engage families, future steps may include additional follow-up as well as the incorporation of trusted supports into the recruitment for and implementation of SAFE-Learning. Psychologists, teachers, and school counselors can then team together to highlight parent-child strengths and address potential risk factors in school.

AB  - Word-to-text integration (WTI) is the ability to integrate words into a mental representation of the text and is important for reading comprehension, but challenging in English as a second language (ESL). However, it remains unclear whether WTI can be trained in seventh grade ESL learners, who often struggle with reading comprehension and display large individual differences. To pay attention to individual differences, the present study examined an adaptive computer game-based WTI-intervention. The intervention, replacing 50 min of ESL classroom instruction, comprized a 12-week program in which students had to complete WTI-based assignments within four serious games, targeting morphosyntactic awareness, translation of words within sentences, recognizing idioms from words in contexts, and a filler game targeting dictation. The intervention group (n = 164) was compared to a control group (n = 166), who only received regular ESL classroom instruction. Both groups completed the following reading measures: decoding, morphological, and syntactic awareness, WTI (argument and anomaly reading speed and processing), and reading comprehension tasks at the beginning (T1) of the school year and at the end (T2) of the school year. Results demonstrated an intervention effect on decoding and anomaly processing as reflected by an interaction between time (T1 vs. T2) and group (intervention vs. control) in a repeated measures MANOVA. Follow-up mediation analyses for the intervention group only - with game performance as mediators between reading measures at T1 and T2 - indicated that students with better T1 scores on reading measures showed more growth in performance within games. More performance growth within the translation game and the idiom recognition game was related to better reading scores at T2. Both high-achieving and low-achieving students displayed performance growth within games, indicating that a WTI intervention yields promising results for a broad variety of ESL readers.

AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to explore the relationships among child cognitive development, provision of care to the child, and the child's iron status through the use of quantitative and qualitative data. Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia remain widespread problems throughout much of the world and have potentially serious consequences for child development and learning outcomes. Cognitive development is influenced both through physiological and psychological mechanisms. Provision of care is a factor that can influence both nutritional status and cognitive development. This longitudinal study addresses the three concurrent relationships between iron status and cognitive development, iron status and interaction with the physical environment, and interaction and provision of care. The first hypothesis is that children between 24 and 42 months with low hemoglobin levels (as defined by Hb ≤ 10.5 g/dl) have lower activity levels, and lower focused activity levels, than the children with higher hemoglobin levels, when observed in the home setting. This was tested using a test of means for two groups, dividing the children into anemic (Hb < 10.5 g/dl) and non-anemic (Hb ≥ 10.5 g/dl). The second set of hypotheses test the relative importance of certain feeding practices on child anemia status, including the age of introduction of fish and the provision and quality of the late afternoon meal, the diogonal. Multiple regressions and ANOVA were used to determine the strength of the association between these practices and iron status, controlling for socio-economic status and age of child. The third set of hypotheses tests the complex relationships between good care practices and activity, attentiveness and learning achievements of the anemic child, with the goal of assessing the degree to which good home care serves to mitigate the negative impacts of iron deficiency on child development. Children with lower iron status but higher levels of maternal interaction and cognitive stimulation will have better cognitive development that children with lower iron status who do not receive as much stimulation. This protective effect will persist beyond early childhood, leading to differences in school performance at age 10-11 years. Multiple regression was used to determine immediate impact of iron status and care on picture vocabulary score (at age 24-42 months) and later impact on school performance (at age 10-11 years). Lower physical activity and lower focused activity that are present in the anemic child have implications for the child's cognitive development. We expect that more attentive mothers will have children with better iron status, but there is also an iterative relationship here where the child with better iron status will attract more maternal interaction and attention. The tests for cognitive outcomes were administered at two different points in time and have implications for the short- and long-term impacts of iron deficiency in early childhood. While the data are specific to the population and culture where the study was conducted, there will be conclusions drawn that will have a more general relevance. This information can be used both to design interventions and to influence policy decisions for early childhood nutrition and education programs.

AB  - The use of written or graphic representations is essential in mathematics. Graphic representations are mainly used and researched as instruments for problem solving. There is a gap in research for interventions that use learner-generated graphic representations as documents for reflection processes for promoting the development of children's graphic representation competences. This is the focus of the study presented here. The study examines to what extent such an intervention has an effect on how the children take into account a mathematical structure in their self-generated graphic representations, how they ensure a mathematical matching with the word problem, and what degree of abstraction they choose. Additionally, the effect on the solution rates is investigated. The results show that children in the intervention group more frequently pay attention to a mathematically appropriate structure, compared with children in the control groups. This result is statistically significant. At the same time, children keep the degree of abstraction relatively constant. Solution rates improve continuously, but the difference is not significant.

AB  - This study used multigroup structural equations to evaluate the possibility that a theory-driven, evidence-based, yearlong reading program for sixth-grade struggling readers moderates the interrelationships among elements of the simple model of reading (i.e., listening comprehension, word reading, and reading comprehension; Hoover & Gough, 1990). Our specific interest was in the relation of theory, program, and evaluation. Our motivating assumptions were that 1) a well-designed, theory-based program affects performance in predictable ways and that 2) treatment effects may be present even when group differences in posttest means are not robust. The analysis sample comprised 327 students, 113 in the business-as-usual condition and 214 in treatment. We pretested students in the fall of sixth grade and collected posttest data in the fall of seventh grade. There were 217 cases in the posttest sample, 47 comparison students and 170 treatment students at posttest. The findings support the possibility that treated sixth-grade students improved in response to an intensive, yearlong intervention, when conceptualizing change in terms of predictable interrelationships of important underlying skills, rather than in terms of group mean differences at posttest. Specifically, the results suggest that verbal knowledge is less proximal to the reading comprehension of students who have become proficient in the use of text processing and reading comprehension strategies.

AB  - The research illustrated throughout this article supports the cycle of creating reading and behavior goals, monitoring of goals, and reflecting on goals to improve future goals. This article provides examples of how teachers of small-group reading interventions can incorporate these brief and targeted self-regulation interventions as part of academic interventions. The benefits of this include an opportunity to address a variety of behavioral and academic needs that often occur with students when providing intensive small-group interventions. As shown in the examples provided throughout the article, the use of self-regulation interventions is adaptable to support students obtaining various academic and behavioral goals that are commonly part of individualized education program (IEP) objectives. By applying the principles outlined in this article and by taking advantage of the examples provided, teachers can take the first steps in adding self-regulation interventions into reading interventions.

AB  - In this article, I illustrate how research from cognitive science and the science of reading can inform research on the science of reading instruction. This purpose is accomplished by focusing on four recently published randomized control trials of instruction designed to teach alphabet letters to 3- and 4-year-old children (N = 342) attending preschool in the United States. Approximately 35% of the children were dual-language learners. Instruction ranged from 10 to 12 weeks' duration and was implemented in small groups taught by research assistants. Evidence for the value of explicit instruction in which paired-associate learning connecting visual letter forms with their verbal letter labels (names and sounds) for learning letters is reviewed. The effectiveness of explicit instruction for promoting children's motivation and engagement is identified. The relation of these studies to important features of a science of reading is discussed. Collective and individual instructionally related implications from the studies are elaborated, including replicated evidence of the benefit of visual-verbal paired-associate learning of printed letters and their spoken names or sounds; the positive effects on motivation and engagement of such instruction; and the benefit of decontextualized letter instruction over letter instruction contextualized within storybook reading, real words, and personal names.

AB  - Examined discriminative validity of the Parent Rating Scale (PRS) of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC; C. R. Reynolds & R. W. Kamphaus, 1992, Circle Pines, MN: American Guidance Services). Two groups were compared: a cohort with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) (n=49; mean age 9.78 yrs) and children from the BASC-PRS standardization sample (n=49) matched on the background characteristics of age, race/ethnicity, and gender. A multivariate, two-group discriminant function analysis was used to compare groups across standard scores from the nine clinical scales of the PRS. Results demonstrated that children with RAP could be differentiated (Wilks λ = .642, F = 6.45, df (9, 88), p < .001), and demonstrated higher scores on the Somatization, Depression, Anxiety, Attention Problems, and Withdrawal scales. Subsequent jackknifed classification analysis, diagnostic efficiency statistics, and an odds ratio for the classification analysis added to the overall validity of results. The practical utility of the BASC-PRS is further supported in light of expanding roles for school psychologists in the assessment and treatment of children with health problems.

AB  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental challenges, including social functioning (SF) and executive functioning (EF) deficits. These deficits present differently across developmental stages from preschool age to adolescence. Methods: The post hoc analyses described here were conducted on data from 83 preschool‐age children with PAE (early childhood group; ages 2.5 to 5.0) and 95 adolescents (49 with PAE, 46 controls; ages 8 to 16). Each child completed EF tasks as part of several prior studies. Parents completed social and communication inventories about their child’s abilities. Thirty‐three participants from the early childhood group returned for a 4‐year follow‐up and completed both SF and EF measures. Results: Both the early childhood and adolescent groups with PAE showed deficits in SF and EF. There was a relationship between SF and EF within the adolescent PAE group that was not present in the adolescent control group or the early childhood PAE group. However, at the 4‐year follow‐up (Mage = 8.45), participants originally in the early childhood PAE group also demonstrated this relationship. Conclusions: These findings support previous research on EF/SF deficits in adolescents with PAE while also addressing a gap in the literature concerning early childhood research on this topic. Additionally, these findings suggest that the relationship between EF and SF deficits may strengthen throughout development. This line of research highlights potential sensitive periods for SF and EF training in children with PAE and suggests that fetal alcohol spectrum disorders programs consider targeting EF training as a component of social skill interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Number sense has been systematically measured using dot comparison tasks. However, recent studies have reported that performance on dot comparison might be influenced inhibitory control and visual properties of dot arrays. In the present study, we analysed the influence of continuous magnitude, inhibitory control, and numerical ratio on the dot comparison performance of preschool children. Methods: Participants were 517 preschool children from 13 different schools in Chile. Children completed a dot comparison and two inhibitory control tasks. Gebuis and Reynvoet method was used to create well-controlled dot arrays for use in the dot comparison task. A logistic mixed effects model was conducted to predict participants' dot comparison accuracy. Continuous magnitude and ratio were entered as level-1 predictors and inhibitory control as level-2 predictors. Results: The results showed that all predictors made a significant contribution to dot comparison accuracy. Furthermore, a significant double interaction (inhibitory control x continuous magnitude) and a triple interaction (inhibitory control x continuous magnitude x ratio) showed that the contribution of inhibitory control skills in dot comparison accuracy depends on the continuous properties of dot arrays and ratio. Discussion: These findings suggest that preschool children rely more on continuous magnitudes than numerosity in dot comparison tasks. They also indicate that the greater children's inhibitory control, the more able they are to respond based on numerosity in fully incongruent trials, particularly when ratio is low (easiest items). Taken together, the above findings support the competing processes account provided that both ANS and inhibitory control skills influence performance on dot comparison tasks.

AB  - Our work applies Universal Design criteria for producing and using Mathematics videos for primary education students, at a time when many countries are shifting towards inclusive education policies. We have focused on how the accessibility criteria used for students with visual impairments might affect non-disabled students. For this, we reviewed applicable Universal Design principles as well as best practices in multimedia learning. We took into account the roles, procedures, tools and standards involved in the multimedia lifecycle. We then undertook an experiment consisting of producing two videos about prime numbers with the same pedagogical contents; one video was accessible for students with visual impairments and the other one was not accessible to them. We conducted a trial in real world school settings with 228 non-disabled children, who were randomly assigned a version, either accessible or not accessible, and were then asked to take a test to measure objective aspects of their learning concerning retention and transfer as well as several subjective aspects, including the attractiveness of the videos. Results indicate that there were no significant differences in the scores obtained by students using either video, although the group who watched the accessible video obtained higher score medians in the retention questions. Moreover, students found the accessible video significantly more attractive (p = 0.042). Our study provides recommendations for different stakeholders and stages within the process of producing multimedia mathematics materials that are accessible to primary students with visual impairments, as well as evidence demonstrating that everybody can benefit from the recommendations for developing good quality, accessible multimedia material.

AB  - In a replication of a study by R. J. Lang and the present 2nd author (see record [rid]1981-01043-001[/rid]), 2 experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of pictures on learning to read a set of isolated, similar, common nouns in a total of 156 kindergarten children. In Exp I, Ss in 4 of 5 groups learned 5 words using a picture of the thing represented by the word. In 2 of the pictorial groups, Ss had their attention drawn to the fact that the word and the picture represented the same thing. Results indicate that both the instructions to associate the word and the picture and the viewing of the word prior to the presentation of the picture failed to improve performance. Ss who learned words in the absence of pictorial information recognized more words on the postlearning trial than Ss in the pictorial groups. In Exp II, Ss in 2 groups learned words with the aid of pictures, with one group seeing the picture 1 sec prior to the word (the primed group) and the other group seeing the picture 1 sec after the word (the nonprimed group). Ss in the remaining 2 groups were used as controls. Results show no difference in performance between the primed and the nonprimed conditions, but, consistent with the 1st study, Ss who did not view pictures outperformed those who did. When teaching children to recognize visually presented words, teachers should abandon the general practice of using pictures as aids.

AB  - The association made between the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of a word has been shown to help children remember the meanings of words. The present study addressed whether the presence of a target word in Braille during instruction facilitated vocabulary learning more efficiently than an auditory-only instructional condition. The authors used an adapted alternating treatments single-case experimental design with three students with visual impairments who read Braille, collecting data on definition recall and spelling during each session. Data on definition recall were used to determine mastery. The results of this study are not consistent with previous findings with students who read print. Visual analyses of the data indicated that participants reached mastery in both conditions, but all three reached mastery on definition recall in fewer sessions in the auditory-only condition. Spellings of words were learned in the flashcard condition only, and possible implications of this are discussed. The difference in the unit of recognition and working memory load between reading Braille and reading print is discussed as one possible explanation.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to examine the academic achievement of non-disabled students educated in co-taught inclusive classrooms and compare it with the academic achievement of non-disabled students educated in non-inclusive [general education] classrooms. Academic achievement was measured by Grade 3 non-disabled students full scale and cluster scores in mathematics on the New Jersey Assessment of Skills and Knowledge. Independent Samples t Tests were performed to account for the variability associated with the differences between the sample means for the comparison groups (i.e., inclusion and non-inclusion). The results of this investigation revealed that there were no statistically significant differences found for overall [full scale] mathematics performance, Geometry and Measurement, Patterns and Algebra, Data Analysis, Probability and Discrete Mathematics, and Problem Solving. A statistically significant difference was found for Number and Numeric Operations specifically, students placed in inclusive classes performed significantly different [better] than students placed in non-inclusion classes. The findings of this study remain tentative as a result of low statistical power (.34). However, the information obtained in this study when combined with similar findings in the larger context of literature can be beneficial to the parents, teachers and administrators in the school where the data was drawn. For instance, the findings can be used by school administration to parlay the fears of parents who believe that inclusive practices result in lower academic performance of general education students [participants]. The findings can also be shared with school faculty who contend that inclusion will force them to teach to the middle and not enrich, on or advanced level students. The results should drive local actions to examine this issue more in the school of study. Future research should focus on: expanding variables, e.g., size and geographic location of school/district, sample diversity in terms of socioeconomic status, gender and ethnicity and incorporating a larger sample size. Such study should sample students across the United States to provide a more comprehensive understanding of inclusive practices on academic achievement.

AB  - We provide evidence on the effectiveness of a school-based program that uses a non-monetary penalty and regular monitoring to prevent risky behavior among adolescents in Indonesia. The field experiment invited students to sign a pledge to abstain from tobacco use and a similar pledge for parents to monitor their children. To test group incentives, a subset of treated schools also competed against each other for the highest tobacco abstinence rates. We find that the individual pledge increases biochemically verified tobacco abstinence by 5 percentage points. This effect is sustained 3 months after the program ended. School competition has no additional impact on tobacco abstinence. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of non-monetary incentives to curb risky behaviors among adolescents who face limited self-control and peer pressure.

AB  - Students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) studying in mainstream classrooms have diverse adjustment difficulties in learning, social interaction, and emotion regulation. It is crucial to identify the areas these students find most challenging so that teachers can provide training and support accordingly. We therefore developed, examined, and provided norms for the Learning, Social and Emotion Adaptation Questionnaire-Short Form (LSEAQ-S), a teacher report instrument measuring 53 essential adaptive behaviors for mainstream primary school students in Hong Kong. Teachers completed the LSEAQ-S for three samples of 2,298, 2,690, and 3,305 students with ASD from 204 schools and a sample of 1,869 students without ASD from 112 schools. Our study showed that an 11-factor structure best describes the LSEAQ-S, which has high internal consistency and good convergent validity examined with the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2). Normative data of the LSEAQ-S stratified by gender and grade (grades 1 to 3; grades 4 to 6) are presented. Gender and grade differences were found, with girls with ASD lagging behind their same-gender peers in related skills more than boys with ASD did, across both grade levels and especially in senior grades. The LSEAQ-S, together with its normative data, can reveal students' difficulties and needs, inform intervention priorities, and help monitor training progress. Lay Summary This study introduces the Learning, Social and Emotion Adaptation Questionnaire-Short Form (LSEAQ-S), a teacher report instrument developed in Hong Kong measuring school adaptation of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mainstream primary schools. The measure helps education personnel identify behaviors in which a student falls behind his/her peers and facilitate training and support targeting those behaviors.

AB  - The role of language in the new standards is profound and has implications for English language learners' (ELL) access to them, particularly when instruction is in English only. With the implementation of the new Common Core Curriculum Standards in Mathematics, teachers need training to support the new mandates. Common Core Standards require that students read and comprehend texts, particularly informational texts, with increasing levels of complexity. To accomplish mathematical learning, students must be able to use and understand mathematical language. The purpose of this experimental study was to examine the relationship of third-grade mathematically promising ELLs' perceptions of classroom environment to their mathematical achievement. The study also examined the effect of curriculum intervention (M3) and students' perceptions of teacher care, teacher challenge, and teacher mastery goal orientation structure and students' perceptions of their learning characteristics on standardized math achievement test scores. A sample of 198 third-grade MPELLs were selected from seven New York City public schools based on their achievement levels and math behaviors. Students were randomly assigned to treatment group and control group. The students in the treatment group received the curriculum intervention (M3) for one year, while the control group were taught standard math curriculum. The math portion of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and student surveys were administered before and after the implementation period. Data were gathered to evaluate the changes in math test scores and students' perceptions of their teachers' and own learning characteristics. This existing data was analyzed using descriptive statistics on pre-, post-, and gain scores of ITBS. An independent sample t test was conducted to examine group differences in pre-, post-, and gains of ITBS. A Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis were used to determine any difference in math test scores between the control and treatment groups and the effect of students' perceptions of teacher care, teacher challenge, teacher mastery goal orientation structure, and students' learning characteristics, critical thinking, metacognitive thinking, time management, task commitment, and preference for challenging task. The results showed that students in the treatment group experienced greater gains than the control group. The significant predictors of math achievement were teacher mastery goal orientation, teacher care, task commitment, time management, and metacognitive thinking. No other variables were found to be predictive of math achievement. The study findings provided evidence of the need for professional development for teachers working with gifted ELLs and for the impact of classroom environment on students' math achievement.

AB  - This chapter puts forward three key ideas for expanding the field of positive education. First, I call for the field to develop evidence-based ways to implicitly deliver wellbeing practices in addition to the current delivery mode of explicit programs. Second, I suggest that the current practice of teaching the content of wellbeing would benefit from including approaches that also build the contexts for wellbeing. Third, I recommend that the field must empower teachers to utilize their own teaching expertise as compared to simply delivering a pre-designed wellbeing curriculum. The core 'change lever' to incorporate implicit approaches, build contexts for wellbeing, and empower teachers is that of pedagogy. 'Positive Education Pedagogy' reflects the idea that how a teacher educates, not just what is taught, is a key factor in building student wellbeing. Infusing positive education into teacher pedagogy allows wellbeing to be built in all classes and subjects across the entire school and not just in those classes that explicitly teach positive education programs. To demonstrate these ideas, a qualitative case study investigating the outcomes of a positive pedagogical intervention is presented. Results of this study found that teachers who are trained in positive education pedagogy are able to legitimize, action, and spread wellbeing. Positive education pedagogy creates change within the teacher, across classrooms, and throughout the school. These findings are explained through three key positive psychology theories: mindsets, broaden and build, and systems informed positive psychology (SIPP).

AB  - High school students in at-risk situations pose one of the greatest challenges to the educational system. Many students in at-risk situations do not possess a sufficient foundation of reading skills or strategies. Much attention has been focused on the best method to teach students in at-risk situations who are experiencing difficulties in reading. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the PLATO Reading Program on the reading achievement of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations. More specifically, the researcher was concerned with the influence of instructional strategies used in the PLATO Reading Program versus instructional strategies of the MILS Program and the TRI Program on the reading achievement of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations. Additionally, this study was designed to ascertain the influence of the variables gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and teachers' attitudes on the reading performance of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations. A Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design was used in this study. One hundred fifty-one (151) at-risk ninth-grade students attending a school district in the southern region of Texas were selected to participate in the study. The Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) examination was used to collect data. Data were treated using two parametric procedures: the One-Way Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and the One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). All hypotheses were tested at the .05 level or better. Analysis of data revealed that ninth-grade students in at-risk situations who were exposed to the Multiple Intelligences and Learning Style method had significantly higher reading scores than their peers who were exposed to the Computer-Assisted method or the Traditional Instruction method. The variables gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status did not produce a significant effect on the reading achievement scores of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations. Furthermore, the type of attitudes held by teachers of ninth-grade students in at-risk situations regarding their reading program was significant. It is recommended that educators who teach at schools with a high number of students in at-risk situations should expose these students to activities that are flexible and that fit their academic and psychological needs. Additionally, educators who are responsible for developing and implementing strategies to improve the academic performance of ninth-grade students in at-risk situation, particularly in reading, should create modules that take into account academic factors more so than demographic factors.

AB  - In 2000, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study was conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It is a worldwide study of 15-year-old students' performance in mathematics, science and reading skills. The study showed relatively poor results for German students' scientific literacy (Prenzel et al., 2001). Although the 2009 PISA study reported that these competencies had improved, there is still a demand in the German education system for the development of methods to improve student performance (Rönnebeck et al., 2010). In the light of this evidence, interdisciplinary teaching (IdT) is often considered to be a useful strategy. IdT is acknowledged as a form of education that is able to impart cross-linked and relevant knowledge to students beyond the bounds of individual disciplines (Ministerium für Schule und Weiterbildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, 1999). This article presents two studies examining IdT's effectiveness in biology and physical education (PE) in the sixth form. This realisation of IdT has not yet been investigated by other studies. The two studies intend to answer the question "Does IdT support the students' skills and knowledge concerning practical application and problem solving better than subject-based teaching?" The first study was conducted with six courses and 141 students, and the second study had six courses and 206 students. Both were conducted for 3 hours a week for a period of 6 weeks. In order to compare effectiveness with that of regular lessons, the studies used a so-called test and control group design. This means that a test group took part in IdT lessons as mentioned above while a control group of peers received "regular" teaching as separate subjects. The effect of different lessons on the students' skills could then be compared. The findings of the studies indicate that there was an improvement in the test groups' knowledge, transfer and problem-solving skills as well as assessment skills in comparison with the control groups. Thus, the effectiveness of IdT units in biology and PE was demonstrated in these two studies. The realisation of the IdT concept presented in this article may function as an inspiration for teachers to use cross-disciplinary teaching units in their everyday teaching.

AB  - In this article, we tested if female adopted Chinese youth’s sense of exclusion predicted their behavioral adjustment and mental disorder diagnoses concurrently (Study 1) and longitudinally 5 years later (Study 2). In Study 1, 224 adoptees (M = 13.6 years, SD = 2.1) provided survey data on sense of exclusion (as indexed by ethnic marginality, ethnic identity search, and negative feelings toward adoption) and Internalizing Problems (i.e., anxiety, withdrawal, and somatic complaints), measured with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)-Youth Self-Report. In Study 1, the adoptive parents additionally completed the CBCL parent-report on the adopted children’s Internalizing Problems and reported if the adopted children had any mental disorder diagnoses. In Study 2, 60 youth from Study 1 (M = 18.6 years, SD = 2.1) completed the 3rd edition of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-Self Report of Personality (BASC-3-SRP) that measures School Problems (i.e., negative attitudes toward teacher, negative attitudes toward school, and sensation seeking), Internalizing Problems (i.e., atypicality, locus of control, social stress, anxiety, depression, sense of inadequacy, and somatization), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; i.e., inattention and hyperactivity), and Personal Adjustment (i.e., relations with parents, peer relations, self-esteem, and self-reliance). They also responded to questions on receiving mental disorder diagnoses and treatments. We found that in Study 1, 33.2% of the youth had at least one diagnosis, with Anxiety Disorder (21.4%), ADD/ADHD (16.7%), and Attachment Disorder (7.5%) being the top three disorders. In Study 2, 40.3% had at least one diagnosis, with Anxiety Disorder (25.0%), Depression (21.7%), and ADD/ADHD (16.7%) being the top three disorders. Path analyses showed that in Study 1, ethnic marginality and negative feelings about adoption, but not ethnic identity search, significantly predicted parent-reported and self-reported Internalizing Problems; in Study 2, none of the three indicators of sense of exclusion predicted the adopted youth’s adjustment. Implications for clinical practice and future research were discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) For female adopted Chinese-American youth, negative attitudes toward adoption and ethnic marginality resulting from their adoption status and racial minority status are risk factors for adjustment and mental health diagnosis. Family centered services and school policies that include adoption-related training for adopted youth, adoptive parents, teachers, and counselors may help promote adopted youth’s sense of pride and belonging.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how explanation is interactively constituted in two mathematics instructional sequences during one year-long teaching experiment in a second grade classroom. The position taken is that classroom norms for what constitutes an acceptable explanation are a joint construction between teacher and students. Previous work shows that in inquiry-oriented mathematics classrooms, students shift from using social reasons to justify mathematical activity to giving explanations based on experientially-real mathematical objects. Explanation itself becomes an object of reflection during this process. The focus on explanation in this study is extended to include an analysis of the relationship between children's explanations and the classroom mathematical practices that emerge as the instructional sequences progress. Findings significantly demonstrate the emerging nature of explanation and clarify the interrelationship between explanation and other classroom mathematical activity. Contains 23 references.

AB  - Context: Attention deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diagnosed in psychiatric outpatient clinics, is the most common psychiatric disorder among schoolchildren. The purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis on subscales related to ADHD examined on schoolchildren. Moreover, it is tried to evaluate meta-analysis of ADHD and its subscales in primary school students in Iran. Evidence Acquisition: Searching through the databases of Magiran, SID, Google Scholar, etc. a total of 16 articles were collected and weighted based on the number of cases and prevalence in binomial distribution. By using a random effects model meta-analysis (I2 = 96.5%), data were analyzed by the use of R and STATA software (version 11.2). Results: In this analysis, 27 articles published between the years of 2001 and 2016 were used. The total sample size was 15124 students whose ages ranged from six to 14 years old. The prevalence of ADHD based on parents and teachers' consensus was 12% (CI 95%: 9.0 - 15), from parents' perspective 15.6% (CI 95%: 9.8 - 21.5), and from teachers' perspective 17.2% (CI 95%: 12.7 - 21.8). The subgroups' prevalence rates based on parents and teachers' consensus were as follows: Attention deficit (AD) = 4.2%, hyperactive impulsive (HI) = 4.1%, and combined type (CT) = 3.5%. ADHD was more prevalent in boys than girls (7.9% versus 5.5%). Conclusions: The results indicated that the prevalence of ADHD among schoolchildren is moderate; therefore, considering the importance of students' mental health, the needs for identification, prevention, and treatment of high-risk groups by responsible institutions become obvious.

AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness digital game-based learning (DGBL) on students’ problem solving, learning motivation, and academic achievement. In order to provide substantive empirical evidence, a quasi-experimental design was implemented over the course of a full semester (23 weeks). Two ninth-grade Civics and Society classes, with a total of 44 students (15–16 years old), were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: an experimental group (incorporating DGBL) and a comparison group (taught using traditional instruction). Two-way mixed ANOVA was employed to evaluate changes in problem solving ability and compare the effectiveness the two strategies, while ANCOVA was used to analyze the effects on learning motivation and academic achievement. The results of this study are summarized as follows: (1) The DGBL strategy was clearly effective in promoting students’ problem solving skills, while the control group showed no improvement. Additionally, data from the mid-test and post-test demonstrate that, as a higher order thinking skill, problem-solving requires a full semester to develop. (2). DGBL resulted in better learning motivation for students in the experimental group as compared to learners receiving TI. (3) Contrary to some suggestions that digital games could inhibit academic achievement, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups. Most importantly, the quantitative improvement in problem-solving and learning motivation suggest that DGBL can be exploited as a useful and productive tool to support students in effective learning while enhancing the classroom atmosphere. Future research in DGBL should emphasize the evaluation of other higher order elements of the cognitive domain in terms of academic achievement outcomes and skills, such as critical and creative thinking.

AB  - Programmable robotics is recently used in early childhood education (ECE) to introduce programming and computational thinking (CT) skills. However, there is a further need for research to contrast the efficacy of children's participation in robot programming and traditionally beneficial ECE activities. The present study thus investigated the effects of a robot programming intervention versus a block play program on kindergarteners' CT, sequencing ability, and self‐regulation. The experiment (robot programming) versus comparison (block play) condition was randomly assigned to four kindergarten classes, which included 101 kindergarteners (M = 64.78 months, SD = 7.64). Statistical analyses revealed that the robot programming group (N = 54) had experienced greater gains over time in sequencing ability relative to those in the block play group (N = 47; F = 5.09, p < 0.05). Children in the robot programming group with lower level of self‐regulation at baseline showed larger improvements in sequencing ability over time relative to the block play group (F = 2.37, p = 0.01). Also, children in the robot programming group with older age showed larger improvements in CT over time relative to the block play group (F = 2.40, p < 0.01). The study demonstrates the positive benefits of robot programming to early childhood development in terms of CT and sequencing ability, compared to a traditional curriculum activity in ECE—block play.

AB  - An intelligent tutoring system plays vital role in education and its importance is constantly increasing, meanwhile the key challenge in the teaching learning process is assessing students’ learning efficiently. In this paper, a hybrid assessment based-on ACT-R cognitive learning theory, combining ontology knowledge map with skills is proposed. In order to assess how well students master knowledge structure, an ontology knowledge map is constructed to describe declarative knowledge; and in order to assess how well students master knowledge skills, a problem solving process is constructed to describe procedural knowledge based on ACT-R. Finally, a student’s mastery of knowledge is assessed through both the knowledge map and skills in the problem solving process, as well as auxiliary indicators like time usage, prior knowledge level, self-assessment, etc. This method is implemented in a geometric intelligent assessment system and is evaluated in a junior high school. Experiments show that the assessment results are consistent with students’ actual learning levels. The hybrid cognitive assessment method can not only obtain the score of students’ mastery of knowledge points and the structure through knowledge map, but also assess the learning skills in problem solving process through exercises quantitatively.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Older children with atopic dermatitis (AD) suffer from poor sleep and attention problems. However, until recently, the dearth of developmentally sensitive assessment tools impeded characterization in younger children. We aimed to characterize sleep and attention problems in young children with AD and identify modifiable factors. Methods: A cross‐sectional study of children with AD aged 1–4 years was stratified by disease severity (Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure), age, and racial/ethnic groups. Developmentally sensitive surveys assessed attention (Multidimensional Assessment Profile of Attention Regulation), sleep, and itch (Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System). Linear regression models identified predictors of sleep health and attention dysregulation. Results: Parents (n = 60) of children aged 2.78 ± 0.98 years with severe (n = 25), moderate (n = 25), or mild (n = 10) AD were recruited across the United States. Significantly reduced sleep health (T‐score ≥ 60) was reported in 86% of children with moderate/severe disease (n = 43), and 50% had ≥5 nights of disturbed sleep per week. A suboptimal sleep environment was identified with 32% of children with too much light, noise, or electronic device usage. With regard to attention regulation, in children with severe AD, 80% had trouble sitting still and 72% of children had trouble paying attention no matter their surroundings. In fully adjusted models, AD severity was a significant predictor of poor sleep health (B = 0.79 [0.31–1.28], p <.01) and attention dysregulation (B = 1.22 [0.51–1.93], p <.01). Conclusions: More severe AD correlates with poor sleep health and attention dysregulation. In addition to aggressive treatment of AD, clinicians should advise on modifiable sleep hygiene practices and consider screening for attention dysregulation in young children.

AB  - As many students have foreign language (FL) anxiety, understanding its potential harm is critical to informing suitable counter-measures. According to social cognitive theory and control-value theory, students with more foreign language (FL) anxiety than other students might have lower FL self-efficacy (which can hinder their FL learning and use) but past studies showed mixed results. Hence, this meta-analysis examined 43 effect sizes from 37 studies of 26,589 students to determine the overall relation between FL anxiety and FL self-efficacy. The results showed a strong negative link between FL anxiety and FL self-efficacy (r = -.704). Moderator analyses showed this link does not differ across school levels, FL anxiety types, measures of FL self-efficacy, language distance, gender, national income, publication year or publication type—suggesting a robust negative link across different contexts. These results suggest the importance of using effective instructional practices/interventions to reduce learners’ language anxiety and enhance their self-efficacy.

AB  - This study is concerned with determining the relative effectiveness of a static and dynamic theoretical model in teaching elementary school students to use the particle idea of matter when explaining certain physical phenomena. A clinical method of personal individual interview-testing, teaching, and retesting of a random sample population from grades 2-6 was used. Students in grades 2 and 3 generally did not use models in any explanations, while students in grades 4, 5, and 6 could be divided into those who did and those who did not. Equal numbers of Modeler and Nonmodeler subjects were assigned randomly to the three treatment groups. One group received no instruction; a second group received 15 minutes instruction using a static model only, and a third group received 15 minutes instruction using a dynamic model. The difference in scores between the first group and the second and third groups was significant and may be attributed to the nature of the treatment received. Also, the scores earned by the Modeler group were significantly higher than those earned by the Nonmodeler group. Data analyzed indicated the dynamic mechanical model was not significantly superior to the static mechanical model as in instructional aid. (GR)

AB  - Purpose: The frequency with which adults reference print when reading with preschool-age children is associated with growth in children's print knowledge (e.g, L.M. justice & H.K. Ezell, 2000, 2002). This study examined whether prekindergarten (pre-K) teachers naturally reference print during classroom shared reading and if verbal print references occur at similar rates across different types of books. The relation between frequency of print referencing and quality of teachers' language instruction was also studied. Method: Seventeen pre-K teachers were randomly assigned to a regular reading condition as part of a larger study, and 92 videos of their large-group, shared-reading sessions were analyzed for print-referencing utterances and quality of language instruction. Teachers' verbal print references were compared across texts that were purposefully sampled to include different levels of print salience. Results: Teachers discussed all domains of print studied; however, their rate of print referencing was relatively low. More verbal print references were observed when the teachers read books exhibiting higher amounts of print-salient features. When reading books, there was no apparent relation between teachers' use of print referencing and their quality of language instruction.. Conclusion: It is unclear whether this low rate of explicit, verbal print referencing would impact children's print knowledge. Nonetheless, print-salient books appear to offer a natural context for discussions about print. Implications for educational practice are considered.

AB  - Inconsistent findings exist for the effect of school-based physical activity interventions on academic performance. The Active Smarter Kids (ASK) study revealed a favorable intervention effect of school-based physical activity on academic performance in numeracy in a subsample of 10-year-old elementary schoolchildren performing poorer at baseline in numeracy. Aiming to explain this finding, we investigated the mediating effects of executive function, behavioral self-regulation, and school related well-being in the relation between the physical activity intervention and child’s performance in numeracy. An ANCOVA model with latent variable structural equation modeling was estimated using data from 360 children (the lower third in academic performance in numeracy at baseline). The model consisted of the three latent factors as mediators; executive function, behavioral self-regulation, and school related well-being. We found no mediating effects of executive function, behavioral self-regulation or school related well-being in the relationship between the ASK intervention and academic performance in numeracy (p ≥ 0.256). Our results suggest that the effect of the intervention on performance in numeracy in the present sample is not explained by change in executive function, behavioral self-regulation, or school related well-being. We suggest this finding mainly could be explained by the lack of effect of the intervention on the mediators, which might be due to an insufficient dose of physical activity.
